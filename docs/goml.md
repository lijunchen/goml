# GoML Syntax Description

This article describes the GoML syntax and key type rules implemented in the current repository, mainly for use by code agents when generating, modifying, and reviewing `.gom` source code. It is not a future design proposal; if something resembles Rust, Go, or OCaml syntax but is not listed here, assume that GoML does not support it.

GoML is a statically typed language with garbage collection. Its syntax is close to Rust, while its semantics are closer to ML. Source code is compiled into Go without Go generics or Go closures after monomorphization and lambda lifting. GoML has no ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, or manual memory management.

## Code agent must first remember the rules

1. The project source code uses `.gom`; the project root directory uses `goml.toml` to declare the canonical module path.
2. Each source file in the project first writes `package name;`, then writes the file's own `use`, and finally writes the top-level definition.
3. Parameters of top-level functions must have types; the return type is fixed to `unit` when omitted and is not inferred from the function body.
4. Generics use square brackets: `Vec[i32]`, `fn id[T](x: T) -> T`, not `<...>`.
5. Generic calls usually rely on type inference; when explicit type arguments are required, write `id::[i32](1)`, not `id[i32](1)` or Rust's `id::<i32>(1)`.
6. `if`, `match`, and `select` are expressions. `if` without `else` must return `unit`; `match` must be exhaustive.
7. The last semicolon-free expression of a block is the block value; adding a semicolon discards the value.
8. `let` and assignment statements must end with a semicolon. Mutable bindings may be introduced with `let mut pattern` or precisely inside a pattern with `mut name`; the semicolon can be omitted for `if`, `match`, `select`, `while`, `loop` and `for` as statements.
9. Enumeration construction uses full names such as `Option::Some(value)`.In patterns, the enum qualifier may be omitted when the matched type determines it, such as `Some(value)` and `None`.
10. For cross-package calls, write `alias::item`.Top-level items, structure fields, and native methods must all be marked with `pub` as required.
11. Before using trait method syntax across packages, import the package and trait with `use alias::Trait;` or a braced import; when in doubt, use UFCS: `Trait::method(value)`.
12. Use `module::path` for a package below the current module root. Do not generate `mod`, `crate::`, `self::`, `super::`, root paths `::x`, Rust references, or Go `var` / `:=`. A user `extern fn` is valid only with the typed Go FFI attribute described below.
13. The test function uses `#[test]`, which must have no parameters, no type parameters and return `unit`; the white-box test is placed in `*_test.gom` of the same package, and the black-box test is placed in the `tests/` directory of the package under test.

## minimal program

Single-file compilation allows omission of `package main;`:

```goml
fn main() -> unit {
    println("hello, goml")
}
```

The entry file in the project should explicitly declare the package:

```goml
package main;

fn main() -> unit {
    println("hello, goml")
}
```

`main` cannot have parameters or type parameters.When generating an executable file, the package selected as the entry must be declared as `package main;` and define `fn main()`.It is recommended to let `main` return `unit`.

## Lexical rules

### identifiers and keywords

Ordinary identifiers only use ASCII and are of the form:

```text
[A-Za-z][A-Za-z_0-9]* | _[A-Za-z_0-9]+
```

The single `_` is a wildcard character, not an ordinary variable name.The current syntax enforces the first letter case of name categories:

- Package names, package aliases in `use package as alias`, functions, methods, parameters, local bindings and fields must start with a lowercase letter or `_`; imported item aliases may follow the naming convention of the imported item;
- Structures, enumerations, traits, enumeration variants, generic parameters, and associated types must start with a capital letter;
- Paths retain the appropriate case for the referenced name.

Enumeration construction should use `Enum::Variant`.Patterns may omit `Enum::` because their expected type determines the variant owner.

Common keywords include:

```text
package use as pub fn struct enum trait impl for type const static where defer
let mut if else match while loop for in break continue return go dyn
true false unit bool isize i8 i16 i32 i64 usize u8 u16 u32 u64
f32 f64 string char extern
```

`import`, `mod`, `crate`, `super` and `array` are not current keywords, but similar old declarations will receive migration diagnostics.`self` is a special abbreviation for the receiver parameter, and can also be used as a common receiver variable name; `Self` has special meaning in the type position of trait and impl.

The white space is not noticeable.Only line comments from `//` to the end of the line are supported, block comments are not supported.

### literal

| category | Syntax example | Default or description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| unit | `()` | Type is `unit` |
| bool | `true`、`false` | Type is `bool` |
| integer | `0`、`42`、`1_000`、`0b1010`、`0o755`、`0xff` | Determined by context; defaults to `isize` when unconstrained |
| floating point number | `1.25`、`1e3`、`2.5e-2` | Determined by context; defaults to `f64` when unconstrained |
| string | `"text"` | Type is `string` |
| raw string | `r"text"`、`r#"text with \"quotes\""#` | Type is `string`; escapes are not processed |
| byte string | `b"text\\n"` | Type is `Vec[byte]`; ASCII contents and byte escapes are supported |
| raw byte string | `br"text"`、`br#"text with "quotes""#` | Type is `Vec[byte]`; escapes are not processed |
| interpolated string | `f"value={value}"` | Type is `string`; embedded values use `ToString` |
| character | `'a'`、`'\n'`、`'\u0041'` | Type is `char`, representing a Unicode scalar value |
| byte | `b'A'`、`b'\n'`、`b'\xFF'` | Type is `byte`, a transparent alias of `u8` |

Numbers have no type suffix.Integer literals support binary `0b`/`0B`, octal `0o`/`0O`, decimal, and hexadecimal `0x`/`0X` forms.The `_` delimiter can be used between two digits; floating point numbers support `e`/`E` exponent and optional exponent sign.When using a decimal point, there must be digits on both sides of the decimal point.Negative numbers are composed of unary `-` and positive numeric literals.

Floating-point literals are rounded directly from their source text to the context-selected `f32` or `f64` width using round-to-nearest, ties-to-even. Overflowing literals are rejected; underflow may round to zero.

Unsuffixed numbers can get the width from the context:

```goml
let small: u8 = 42;
let ratio: f32 = 0.5;
let values: [i16; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
```

Strings support `\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\b`, `\f`, `\/` and four-digit `\uXXXX` escaping; characters are escaped using the same set of control characters, and `\'` is used to represent single quotes. Ordinary strings cannot span lines.

Raw strings use `r"..."` or matching hash delimiters such as `r#"..."#` and `r##"..."##`. Their contents may span lines, and backslashes, quotes, braces, and newlines are retained exactly. Escapes and interpolation are not processed. A quote closes the literal only when it is followed by the same number of `#` characters as the opening delimiter:

```goml
let windows_path = r"C:\users\alice";
let quoted = r#"She said "hello"."#;
let multiline = r##"first line
second line"##;
```

Interpolated strings use `f"..."`. Each `{expression}` is evaluated once from left to right and converted with `ToString`; a value that is already `string` is inserted directly. Write `{{` and `}}` for literal braces. Formatting specifications and interpolated multiline strings are not supported:

```goml
let name = "Ada";
let count = 3;
let message = f"{name} has {count} items {{ready}}";
```

Byte literals contain exactly one ASCII byte and support `\'`, `\\`, `\0`, `\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, and two-digit `\xNN` escapes. Non-ASCII contents are rejected.

Byte strings use `b"..."` and have type `Vec[byte]` without an expected type. In a `[byte; N]` context they produce a fixed array and the length must match. Vector byte strings compile to one backing-slice allocation with batch literal initialization rather than per-byte `push` calls. Ordinary byte strings accept ASCII contents together with `\"`, `\\`, `\0`, `\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\/`, and two-digit `\xNN` escapes. Unicode escapes and non-ASCII source characters are rejected:

```goml
let request = b"GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n";
let marker = b"\x00\xFF";
```

Raw byte strings use `br"..."` or matching hash delimiters such as `br#"..."#`. Their contents may span lines and are copied as ASCII bytes without escapes or interpolation:

```goml
let path = br"C:\tmp\file";
let quoted = br#"say "hello""#;
```

The standard library type `std::bytes::Bytes` remains a separate buffer abstraction. Use `bytes::Bytes::from_vec(value)` when an API requires it.

Each line of a multiline string begins with two backslashes; the indentation before the mark is removed, the lines are connected with newlines, and the content after the mark is retained as is.At the end, the next line no longer starts with two backslashes, usually written directly `;` or `}`:

```goml
fn poem() -> string {
    let text = \\roses are red
        \\violets are blue
        \\"quotes" need no escaping here
    ;
    text
}
```

## Modules, packages and imports

### `goml.toml`

A project module declares the canonical path in the root directory:

```toml
[module]
path = "alice::myapp"

[build]
target-dir = "_artifact"

[dependencies]
"alice::http" = "1.2.0"
```

Dependency versions must use the strict `X.Y.Z` form. A dependency version is a minimum version requirement resolved using MVS; there is currently no `goml.lock`.

`[build]` can be omitted; `build.target-dir` defaults to `_artifact` under the module root. The manifest value must be a non-empty relative path and cannot contain a `..` segment. `goml check`, `goml build`, `goml run`, and `goml test` can temporarily override it with `--target-dir <path>`; command-line overrides may be relative or absolute. `goml clean` removes the configured target directory. Its optional `--target-dir <path>` override must stay inside the module.

Each module path segment must be non-empty and may contain ASCII letters, digits, `_`, and `-`. Paths rooted at `builtin` or `prelude` are reserved for the toolchain and cannot be used as a module path or dependency. The `[module]` section currently has no `name`, `kind`, `root`, or similar fields.

### Build product catalog

The default product layout is as follows; the standard package paths in the path are expanded by directory level, for example, `alice::myapp::utils` corresponds to `alice/myapp/utils`:

```text
_artifact/
├── check/
│   ├── pkg/<canonical-package-path>/<last-path-segment>.interface
│   └── deps/<owner>/<module>/<version>/pkg/<canonical-package-path>/<last-path-segment>.interface
├── build/
│   ├── pkg/<canonical-package-path>/<last-path-segment>.interface
│   ├── pkg/<canonical-package-path>/<last-path-segment>.core
│   ├── pkg/<entry-package-path>/goml_generated.go
│   └── deps/<owner>/<module>/<version>/pkg/<canonical-package-path>/<last-path-segment>.*
├── test/
│   ├── base/
│   │   ├── pkg/<canonical-package-path>/<last-path-segment>.*
│   │   └── deps/<owner>/<module>/<version>/pkg/<canonical-package-path>/<last-path-segment>.*
│   ├── internal/
│   │   ├── pkg/<canonical-package-path>/<last-path-segment>.*
│   │   ├── goml_generated.go
│   │   ├── tests.json
│   │   └── runner
│   └── external/
│       ├── pkg/<black-box-test-package-path>/<last-path-segment>.*
│       ├── goml_generated.go
│       ├── tests.json
│       └── runner
└── bin/
    ├── <module-name>
    └── <module-relative-entry-path>/<entry-name>
```

`<last-path-segment>` is the last segment of the canonical package path, not the package name declared in the source code; for example, `alice::app::cmd::server` declared as `package main` still uses `server.core` and `server.interface`.

`check` only requires interface artifacts; `build` and `test` also generate Core. Each entry package declared as `package main` generates a Go link file named `goml_generated.go` in its own artifact directory; ordinary library packages do not generate Go link files. Fixed filenames do not trigger Go's special file rules when a package path ends with `_test`, an operating system name, or an architecture name.

Interface and Core artifacts use the deterministic GAF binary container. GAF
payloads are encoded directly from compiler data without an intermediate JSON
value tree.

`for` loops over builtin `range`, `Vec`, and `Slice` values lower directly to indexed loops without allocating iterator closures.

The executable file of the module root entry package is `bin/<module name>`; the nested entry package retains the directory within the module and appends the entry name. For example, the output of `alice::app::cmd::server` is `bin/cmd/server/server`. Production test dependencies are built once under `test/base`; internal and external tests each share one Go entry, manifest, and runner at the corresponding test-kind root. The runner file has the `.exe` suffix on Windows. External dependencies use the same `deps/<owner>/<module>/<version>/pkg/...` structure in the root directory of each stage.

The configured production directory will not participate in package discovery and cannot be a target to be inspected, built, or tested.The `.gitignore` generated by `goml new` contains `/_artifact/` by default; after modifying `build.target-dir`, the project's own `.gitignore` should be modified simultaneously.

### Catalog package

Each directory containing a `.gom` file is a package.All source files in the same directory must declare the same package name:

```goml
package utils;
```

The canonical identity of a package is the module path plus the relative directory path.The package declaration name determines the local name when imported without aliases, but not the global identity of the package.The canonical identity of the root package is the module path.

A typical project could be:

```text
goml.toml
main.gom
utils/utils.gom
```

`utils/utils.gom`：

```goml
package utils;

pub fn message() -> string {
    "hello"
}
```

`main.gom`：

```goml
package main;

use alice::myapp::utils;

fn main() -> unit {
    println(utils::message())
}
```

### `use`

`use` is a file-level declaration and must be placed after `package` and before any top-level items.Imports are not shared between different files.

Imports are not transitive: package A imports package B, which does not allow files using A to automatically see B.Each file must directly import each package it references.

```goml
use alice::http::client;
use alice::http::client as http_client;
```

The contextual `module` path head denotes the canonical path declared by the current project's `[module].path`. It may be used from any package in that module, including modules whose canonical path contains multiple segments:

```goml
use module::http::client;
use module::rendering::api::{Canvas, Render};
pub use module::model::Request;
```

For a module declared as `alice::myapp`, these paths resolve to `alice::myapp::http::client`, `alice::myapp::rendering::api`, and `alice::myapp::model::Request`. The marker applies only at the start of a `use` path followed by `::`; dependency paths and aliases named `module` elsewhere retain their ordinary meaning. External dependencies continue to use canonical paths such as `alice::http::client`.

After importing the package, access its public items through local aliases:

```goml
let request = http_client::new_request();
```

Braced imports bring selected public top-level items directly into the current file. Functions, constants, structs, enums, type aliases, and traits can be imported, and each item may be renamed independently:

```goml
use alice::rendering::api::{Canvas, Color as Paint, Render, render_to_string};

fn describe(canvas: Canvas) -> string {
    render_to_string(canvas)
}
```

The path before the braces is always a package path. Nested braced imports, `self`, glob imports with `*`, enum-variant imports, and subpackage aggregation are not supported. Imported names remain file-local, and normal top-level visibility rules apply.

The following special form also adds a trait from an already loaded package to the method calling scope:

```goml
use alice::rendering::api;
use api::Render;
```

Importing `Render` in a braced list also adds it to the method scope. Afterwards, the specific value can be written as `value.render()`.Even if the trait is not added to the method scope, you can still write a qualified call to `api::Render::render(value)`.

`pub use` re-exports a named package or public item from the current package without changing its identity:

```goml
pub use alice::http::client;
pub use client::{Client, Request, Response};
pub use client::Request as HttpRequest;
```

Downstream code can use `facade::HttpRequest`, import it directly, or bring a re-exported trait into method scope. The compiler resolves every such path back to the original declaration, so constructors, trait implementations, methods, constants, and functions behave exactly as they do at the original path. Re-exported package namespaces also remain usable, for example `facade::client::Request`. Re-export names in one package must be unique. Glob re-exports remain unsupported.

The following path models are not supported:

```text
mod child;
crate::x
self::x
super::x
::rooted::x
```

### visibility

Top-level items are only visible within the package by default.Top-level functions, structures, enumerations and traits are exported using `pub`; structure fields and inherent impl methods are also private by default and need to be marked `pub` separately for cross-package access:

```goml
pub struct Point {
    pub x: i32,
    pub y: i32,
}

pub fn origin() -> Point {
    Point { x: 0, y: 0 }
}

impl Point {
    pub fn sum(self) -> i32 {
        self.x + self.y
    }
}
```

All files in the same package can use private top-level items.The trait impl method inherits the visibility of the trait method and cannot write `pub`.

## type

### Basic types and composite types

| type | Example | illustrate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| unit | `unit` | The only value is `()`; `()` is not a type notation |
| Boolean | `bool` | `true`、`false` |
| raw integer | `isize` | Corresponds to the `int` of the target Go platform and is also the default type of integers. |
| signed integer | `i8`、`i16`、`i32`、`i64` | fixed width |
| unsigned integer | `usize`、`u8`、`u16`、`u32`、`u64` | `usize` corresponds to the target Go platform's `uint`; the others have fixed widths |
| byte | `byte` | Transparent builtin alias of `u8` |
| floating point | `f32`、`f64` | IEEE floating point |
| string | `string` | Go string backend |
| character | `char` | Compile to Go `rune` |
| tuple | `(i32, string)` | Tuples in type syntax have at least two elements |
| fixed array | `[i32; 4]` | The length is part of the type |
| function | `(i32, string) -> bool` | parameter type list to return type |
| Generic application | `Option[i32]`、`pkg::Box[string]` | Use square brackets |
| channel | `Channel[isize]`, `Sender[isize]`, `Receiver[isize]` | Bidirectional and directional Go channel backends |
| trait object | `dyn Render`、`dyn Iterator[Item = isize]` | A single, non-generic dyn-safe trait; associated types must be bound |
| Associative type projection | `I::Item`、`Self::Output`、`I::IntoIter::Item` | There must be corresponding trait constraints; projections may be chained |

The `0.1.35` transition release accepted the former numeric type spellings and conversion method names. They are removed in `0.1.36`; migrate to the names in the table above and to the compact conversion methods before upgrading.

Example of function type:

```goml
let predicate: (i32) -> bool = |value: i32| value > 0;
let combine: (i32, i32) -> i32 = |a, b| a + b;
let action: () -> unit = || println("run");
```

`(value)` in value and pattern is a group, `(value,)` is a single-element tuple.The current type syntax cannot directly annotate single-element tuples: `(T,)` still normalizes to `T`, so the type of such values ​​must be inferred from the local context.

`A -> B -> C` is parsed by right associative analysis.It is recommended to always write function argument lists in parentheses, especially for higher-order functions: `(A) -> (B) -> C` .

The array length must be a non-negative decimal integer in the source code, not a constant expression:

```goml
let pair: [string; 2] = ["left", "right"];
```

The number of array literal elements must match the array type.Empty arrays and empty generic containers usually require type annotations.

### Type aliases

Top-level aliases are transparent and may have type parameters:

```goml
type UserId = u64;
type Pair[T] = (T, T);
pub type Names = Vec[string];
```

Aliases do not create nominally distinct types and recursive alias cycles are rejected.Public aliases can be referenced across packages.

Use a single-field tuple struct when a value needs a distinct nominal type instead of an alias:

```goml
struct UserId(u64);
struct Box[T](T);
```

This form is the newtype pattern. Construct it with `UserId(value)`, access its field with `value.0`, and destructure it with `let UserId(inner) = value;`. The field is private by default. A public newtype that can be constructed and unwrapped across package boundaries marks both the type and field public: `pub struct UserId(pub u64);`.

### Type syntax not currently available

GoML has no Rust references and lifetimes, raw pointers, nullable types, slice literals, or union types.Use `Ref[T]` to express shared variable units, use `Option[T]` to express optional values, and use `Slice[T]` to express read-only continuous views.

`A + B` is only usable as a trait bound or supertrait list. The parser reserves `dyn A + B`, but the type checker deliberately rejects multiple dyn bounds in the current object model.

`Self` is only used in the trait signature and the type position of impl; ordinary top-level functions cannot use `Self` as an implicit type parameter.

## top level definition

The top level of an ordinary source code file should only contain:

- `fn`
- `struct`
- `enum`
- `trait`
- `impl`
- `type`
- `const`
- `static`

`package` and `use` can only appear at the beginning of a file.The top level cannot write local variables or arbitrary execution statements.

### Constants

Top-level constants require an explicit type and a compile-time expression:

```goml
const BASE: i32 = 0x20;
pub const ANSWER: i32 = BASE + 10;
const NEWLINE: byte = b'\n';
```

Constant names may start with an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, or `_`; `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` is the preferred convention. Constant expressions support literals, constructors, references to other constants, unary and binary operators, integer conversion methods, and comptime-capable calls. They may use forward references, but cycles are rejected. Allowed constant types are recursively immutable values: `bool`, numeric types, `string`, `char`, `byte`, tuples, fixed arrays, and structs or enums whose fields satisfy the same rule. `Vec`, `HashMap`, `Ref`, `Channel`, closures, and dynamic values are rejected. Composite constants cannot be used as patterns. Public constants are available through package-qualified paths.

### Statics and one-time initialization

A top-level `static` has one program-wide storage location. Its binding cannot be reassigned. In the first supported form, its explicit type must be `OnceCell[T]` and its initializer must be exactly `OnceCell::new()`:

```goml
static EMOJI: OnceCell[FrozenVec[FrozenVec[u16]]] = OnceCell::new();

fn emoji() -> FrozenVec[FrozenVec[u16]] {
    EMOJI.get_or_init(|| build_emoji().freeze())
}
```

`OnceCell.get_or_init(init)` runs one initializer and caches its result. Concurrent first callers wait for that initializer and receive the same value. Recursive initialization of the same cell terminates with an error that names the static. A cached `Result` is an ordinary cached value. Statics do not run user-observable destruction at process exit.

Unlike a `const`, a `static` has observable identity. `OnceCell[T]` controls initialization but does not make `T` immutable. Shared caches should therefore expose `FrozenVec` or another immutable value instead of a mutable `Vec`.

Visible top-level constants can be used as value patterns in `match`, `if let`, `while let`, and `let else`. Both local names and package-qualified names are supported, and constant patterns can be nested or combined with or-patterns:

```goml
const ANSWER: isize = 42;

match value {
    ANSWER | config::FALLBACK => "known",
    _ => "other",
}
```

In these refutable pattern contexts, a visible constant takes precedence over introducing a binding with the same name. Use an explicit alias such as `answer @ _` to bind that name instead. Ordinary `let` bindings and `for` patterns continue to introduce bindings, even when a top-level constant has the same name. Range-pattern endpoints remain integer or character literals.

### Compile-time evaluation

`comptime { expression }` requires the expression to be evaluated while the current package is compiled. Its static type is the type of the inner expression, and the compiler replaces it with an equivalent ordinary value before Core lowering:

```goml
#[comptime]
fn factorial(value: isize) -> isize {
    if value < 2 {
        1
    } else {
        value * factorial(value - 1)
    }
}

const SIX: isize = factorial(3);

fn table() -> [isize; 4] {
    comptime {
        [factorial(1), factorial(2), factorial(3), factorial(4)]
    }
}
```

`#[comptime]` marks a non-generic free function as compile-time-capable. The function remains callable at runtime. A compile-time call may call only other `#[comptime]` free functions or the `compile_error(string) -> never` intrinsic. The compiler validates the complete body of every marked function, including branches not taken by a particular invocation. Attributes with arguments, duplicate attributes, generic functions, methods, extern functions, and other declarations are rejected.

A top-level constant initializer is an implicit compile-time context, so `const SIX: isize = factorial(3);` and an initializer wrapped in `comptime { ... }` are equivalent. A top-level constant may produce a recursively immutable tuple, fixed array, struct, or enum in addition to scalar values. A `comptime` expression in ordinary code supports the same reifiable value shapes.

Compile-time code may use local bindings and assignment, blocks, `if`, `match`, `while`, `loop`, restricted `for`, `break`, `continue`, `return`, recursion, direct calls, integer conversion methods, and supported operators. A compile-time `for` accepts only a fixed array or the builtin `isize` ranges `start..end` and `start..=end`; its source and range endpoints are evaluated once, and its pattern must be irrefutable. The deterministic string methods `len`, `byte_len`, `get`, `byte_get`, `byte_slice`, `is_char_boundary`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, and `contains` are also available. String indexes and slices use byte offsets and reject invalid UTF-8 character boundaries.

Compile-time code cannot capture a surrounding runtime parameter or local. Closures, indirect calls, generic functions, methods other than the integer conversions and string whitelist, trait or dynamic dispatch, general iterators, floating-point computation, `Ref`, `Vec`, `HashMap`, channels, goroutines, extern calls, host I/O, environment access, time, randomness, network access, general type reflection, arbitrary declaration generation, compile-time parameters, value generics, and type-level computation are not supported. The constrained programmable derive interface described below is the only reflection and code-generation facility.

`compile_error` is accepted only in a `#[comptime]` function, a `comptime` block, or a top-level constant initializer. It terminates compile-time evaluation with its message. If runtime execution of a `#[comptime]` function reaches it, the program traps:

```goml
#[comptime]
fn checked_size(value: isize) -> isize {
    if value < 0 {
        compile_error("size must be non-negative")
    } else {
        value
    }
}
```

Failures include the compile-time call stack and source locations. Evaluation uses deterministic instruction, call-depth, temporary-value-node, temporary-memory, and final-value-size limits. Exceeding a limit is a compile error; no wall-clock timeout participates in the language semantics. Successful direct calls are memoized within one evaluation. Memoization is not observable because compile-time code has no user-visible side effects.

Public `#[comptime]` functions can be called from another package. The defining package's interface contains verified compile-time IR for the public entry and the private compile-time helpers and constants it reaches. Public compile-time constant values are also exported. A compile-time body or value change affects the interface hash; source formatting, local names, and source locations do not. A downstream package needs only the dependency interface for checking and evaluation. A value containing hidden fields from another package cannot currently be reified.

Compile-time integer evaluation uses the same fixed-width, wrapping representation as generated runtime code. Division by zero, a negative shift count, and an out-of-bounds index fail compilation. Signed minimum divided by `-1` yields the signed minimum, and its remainder is zero. Narrowing conversions retain the low bits of the destination width; widening a signed source sign-extends before conversion to the destination signedness. The CTIR target specification is part of its semantic hash. `isize` and `usize` currently use the 64-bit Linux amd64 toolchain target width.

At runtime, integer addition, subtraction, and multiplication use the same fixed-width wrapping representation. Integer division or remainder by zero terminates the current process with the generated Go runtime failure. Integer conversion methods use the same narrowing, sign-extension, and signedness rules as compile-time evaluation.

### Structure

```goml
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

struct Box[T] {
    value: T,
}
```

A newtype is a nominal structure with exactly one unnamed field:

```goml
struct UserId(u64);

fn increment(value: UserId) -> UserId {
    UserId(value.0 + 1)
}
```

Unlike `type UserId = u64;`, the newtype is not interchangeable with `u64`. It must be explicitly constructed or destructured. Newtypes may be generic, their field is private by default, and a trailing comma inside the parentheses is accepted. This syntax requires exactly one field; tuple structs with zero or multiple fields are not supported.

The type parameter list of structure and enumeration itself does not write bound.Put constraints on functions, traits, or impl that use the type.

Write out the fields during construction, allowing field abbreviations:

```goml
fn make_point(x: i32, y: i32) -> Point {
    Point { x, y }
}
```

Field access uses dot notation:

```goml
let x = point.x;
```

Structure update copies omitted fields from a base value of the same structure type. The `..base` item must be last. Explicit field expressions are evaluated from left to right, followed by the base expression, and every expression is evaluated once:

```goml
let moved = Point {
    x: point.x + 1,
    ..point,
};
```

Structure update is rejected when inaccessible fields prevent construction across a package boundary.

Directly recursive structures will have infinite size and must be recursed through indirect layers such as `Ref` and `Vec`:

```goml
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option[Ref[Node]],
}
```

### enumerate

```goml
enum Message[T] {
    Quit,
    Value(T),
    Pair(T, T),
    Named {
        value: T,
    },
}
```

Unloaded variants are used directly as values, loaded variants are called like functions:

```goml
let quit: Message[i32] = Message::Quit;
let value: Message[i32] = Message::Value(42);
let pair = Message::Pair("left", "right");
let named = Message::Named { value: 42 };
```

Unloaded generic variants provide no inference clues, usually the expected type is given:

```goml
let none: Option[i32] = Option::None;
```

Loaded constructors are also available as first-class function values:

```goml
let some: (i32) -> Option[i32] = Option::Some;
```

Structural variants use field constructs and field patterns:

```goml
match named {
    Message::Named { value } => value,
    _ => 0,
}
```

Patterns may omit the enum qualifier.When the expected pattern type is `Option[T]`, `Some(value)` and `None` resolve to `Option::Some(value)` and `Option::None`.The same rule applies to unit, tuple-like, and struct-like variants of user enums, including enums imported from another package and enums reached through a type alias.Duplicate variant names in unrelated enums are not ambiguous because the expected enum type selects the owner.Nested patterns are resolved recursively, so `Some(Ok(value))` uses the payload type of `Some` to resolve `Ok`.

## Functions and generics

### top-level function

```goml
fn add(left: i32, right: i32) -> i32 {
    left + right
}

fn log(message: string) {
    println(message)
}
```

The parameter type cannot be omitted.Omitting `-> ...` is equivalent to `-> unit`.The top-level function name must be unique in the same package, and overloading by parameter type is not supported.

### Generic function

```goml
fn identity[T](value: T) -> T {
    value
}

fn render[T: ToString + Eq](value: T) -> string {
    value.to_string()
}
```

Constraints can also be placed in a `where` clause:

```goml
use std::iter;

fn collect_items[T, I: Iterator](iterator: I) -> Vec[T]
where
    I::Item = T,
{
    iter::collect(iterator)
}
```

There are currently two types of `where` predicates:

```text
Type: TraitA + TraitB
TypeA = TypeB
```

Ordinary generic function calls usually infer the type arguments from the argument and expected result types:

```goml
let number: i32 = identity(1);
let text: string = identity("text");
```

Use GoML turbofish when explicit specification is required:

```goml
let number = identity::[i32](1);
let text = identity::[string]("text");
```

Don't write `identity[i32](1)` or Rust's `identity::<i32>(1)`. Generic arguments for an owner type or trait appear before the member name, while arguments owned by a method appear after it:

```goml
let inferred = value.convert(fallback);
let explicit = value.convert::[string](fallback);
let inherent = Box::[i32]::convert::[string](value, fallback);
let trait_call = Convert::[i32]::convert::[string](value, fallback);
```

Top-level functions and methods may introduce their own type parameters. A method's parameters are distinct from the parameters of its enclosing trait or impl and may have their own bounds and `where` predicates. Local named functions do not exist; use closures. Closures do not have generics. Structures, enumerations, traits, and impl blocks can also have type parameters.

GoML monomorphizes generic calls.Recursive generic code must produce a limited number of concrete instances and cannot continually change to a new nested type with each recursive call.

## Blocks, bindings and assignments

### Block values ​​and semicolons

The last semicolon-less expression of the block is the return value:

```goml
fn square(value: i32) -> i32 {
    let result = value * value;
    result
}
```

A block without a tail expression returns `unit`.Adding `;` after an expression turns it into an expression statement and discards the result:

```goml
fn run() -> unit {
    println("first");
    1 + 2;
}
```

`let`, ordinary assignments, and general non-tail expression statements require semicolons.When used as statements and followed by code, `if`, `match`, `while`, `loop` and `for` can omit the semicolon; other expression statements still require semicolons.Functions, brace-delimited structures, enumerations, traits, impl and blocks themselves are not declared with a semicolon after them. Newtype declarations such as `struct UserId(u64);` do require the trailing semicolon.

`defer expression;` registers a `unit` expression to run when the current lexical block is left. Deferred expressions run in last-in-first-out order on normal completion and when `return`, `?`, `break`, or `continue` crosses their block. A return or break value is evaluated before cleanup begins. Each loop-body block has its own cleanup stack, so a deferred expression registered during one iteration runs before that iteration exits.

Unlike Go's `defer`, GoML does not evaluate call arguments when the statement is reached. The complete expression is evaluated at block exit, so reads through `Ref` observe the value at cleanup time. A closure body is a separate control-flow scope. Deferred expressions cannot contain `return`, `break`, `continue`, or `?`, and cleanup during an unrecovered runtime panic is not currently guaranteed. The compiler lowers cleanup to ordinary structured control flow and never emits a Go `defer` statement.

```goml
fn work() -> unit {
    let state = Ref::new("open");
    defer println("closing:" + state.get());
    defer println("flush");
    state.set("ready")
}
```

This prints `flush` first, then `closing:ready`.

### `let`, type annotations and shadowing

```goml
let inferred = 42;
let explicit: i64 = 42;
let _ = println("discard explicitly");
let name = "first";
let name = "second";
```

Local variables allow shadowing with the same name.`let _ = expr;` executes explicitly and discards the result.

The left side of `let` can be an irrefutable pattern:

```goml
let (left, right) = pair;
let Point { x, y: vertical } = point;
```

An ordinary `let` cannot use an enumeration or literal pattern that may fail. Use `let ... else` when the failure path must leave the surrounding control flow:

```goml
fn require_value(value: Option[isize]) -> isize {
    let Some(item) = value else {
        return -1;
    };
    item
}
```

The initializer is evaluated once. The pattern must be refutable, bindings become visible after the statement, and the `else` block cannot use those bindings. The `else` block must diverge with `return`, `break`, `continue`, an infinite `loop`, or another expression of type `never`. Use `if let` or `match` when both paths continue locally.

### `mut` and assignment

```goml
let mut count = 0;
count = count + 1;
```

Destructuring patterns can mark only selected bindings mutable:

```goml
let (mut index, value) = pair;

match state {
    Some(mut count) => {
        count += 1;
    },
    None => (),
};

for mut item in values {
    item += 1;
}
```

`mut` inside a pattern is allowed only on a binding and does not introduce borrowing or reference semantics. The existing `let mut pattern = value;` form remains supported and recursively makes every binding in that pattern mutable. Per-binding `mut` composes with tuple, struct, enum, array, `match`, and `for` patterns.

Ordinary local bindings without `mut` cannot be reassigned.Assignment targets include mutable locals, tuple projections, structure fields, and supported index locations. Compound assignment supports `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, and `>>=`:

```goml
count += 1;
point.x *= 2;
values[index] <<= 1;
```

The target root and each index are evaluated once before the right-hand side. `++` and `--` are not supported. Compound assignment through `HashMap` indexing is not supported because an indexed read returns `Option[V]`; use `get` and `set`, or ordinary indexed assignment.

Array index assignment requires that the root value is a `let mut` local array, or comes from the built-in `Ref.get()`:

```goml
let mut values = [1, 2, 3];
values[1] = 20;

let shared = Ref::new([4, 5]);
shared.get()[0] = 40;
```

`Vec` and `HashMap` are internal mutable containers, so the contents can be modified via methods or indexes even if the binding itself is not `mut`:

```goml
let values: Vec[i32] = Vec::new();
values.push(10);
values[0] = 20;

let counts: HashMap[string, i32] = HashMap::new();
counts["answer"] = 42;
```

`Slice[T]` is a read-only view and cannot be assigned by index.

## Expressions and operators

### basic expression

GoML supports:

- Literals, variables and paths
- Tuple, array, and structure literals
- Block expressions `{ ... }`
- Function call `f(a, b)`
- Field access `value.field`
- Tuple projection `pair.0`, `triple.2`
- Method call `value.method(arg)`
- Index `value[index]`
- Unary and binary operations
- Integer conversion method `value.to_u32()`
- Explicit trait-object conversion `value as dyn Trait`
- Half-open range expression `start..end`
- `if`、`if let`、`match`、`select`、`while`、`while let`、`loop`、`for`
- closure
- `return`, `break`, `continue`, `go` and `?`

A block is an expression in any ordinary expression position. Its last expression without a semicolon supplies the value; a block without a tail expression has type `unit`:

```goml
let answer = {
    let base = 40;
    base + 2
};

return {
    cleanup();
    answer
};
```

In an `if`, `if let`, `while`, `while let`, `for`, or `match` header, the top-level `{` starts the control-flow body. Parenthesize a block expression used as the header value:

```goml
if ({
    prepare();
    ready()
}) {
    run()
}
```

### operator precedence

From low to high:

| Hierarchy | operator | illustrate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `..` | Half-open range; cannot be used in chains |
| 2 | ` |  | ` | short circuit logic or |
| 3 | `&&` | short circuit logical AND |
| 4 | `==`、`!=`、`<`、`>`、`<=`、`>=` | Compare; not chainable |
| 5 | `\ | ` | Bitwise OR |
| 6 | `^` | Bitwise XOR |
| 7 | `&` | Bitwise AND |
| 8 | `<<`、`>>` | shift |
| 9 | `+`、`-` | Addition, subtraction, string concatenation |
| 10 | `*`、`/`、`%` | Multiplication, division, remainder |
| 11 | `as` | explicit `dyn Trait` conversion |
| 12 | Call `()`, index `[]`, `?`, member `.` | suffix |
| 13 | One dollar `-`, `!`, `~` | prefix |

The binary operator is left associative, and the function type `->` is right associative.Don’t write comparisons in chains; use combinations of logical operations:

```goml
let inside = lower <= value && value < upper;
```

Since the current combination of calls, `?` , unary operations, and dot notation are not exactly equivalent to Rust, it is safest to explicitly add parentheses when mixing them:

```goml
let negative = -(compute());
let valid = !(predicate());
```

### Operator type rules

- The two numeric operands of `+ - * /` must be of the same concrete numeric type; there is no implicit numeric promotion.
- `%` only accepts integers of the same type.
- `& | ^ ~` only accepts integers, and both sides of binary bitwise operations must be of the same type.Both sides of `<< >>` must be integers and the result type is the same as the left operand.
- `+` also supports `string + string`.
- `&& || !` only accepts `bool`.
- The unary `-` only accepts signed integers or floating point numbers.
- Both sides of the comparison must be of the same type.
- `< > <= >=` uses `PartialOrd`. Primitive numbers, `string`, `char`, tuples, fixed arrays, `Vec`, `Slice`, `Option`, and `Result` provide the corresponding conditional implementations.
- `== !=` uses `PartialEq`. Tuples, fixed arrays, `Vec`, `Slice`, `Option`, and `Result` compare recursively when their elements implement `PartialEq`.
- Floating-point values implement `PartialEq + PartialOrd`, but not `Eq + Ord + Hash`. In particular, NaN is unequal to itself and its `partial_cmp` result is `None`.
- Every integer type provides `to_isize`, `to_i8`, `to_i16`, `to_i32`, `to_i64`, `to_usize`, `to_u8`, `to_u16`, `to_u32`, and `to_u64` for the other integer types. Identity methods are omitted. `byte` uses the `u8` methods, `char` provides `to_u32`, and `u32` to `char` uses `char_from_u32`, which returns `Option[char]`.
- `f32` provides `to_bits` and `to_f64`; `f64` provides `to_bits` and `to_f32`. The prelude functions `float32_from_bits` and `float64_from_bits` reconstruct values from their IEEE 754 bit patterns. The `f64` to `f32` conversion uses round-to-nearest, ties-to-even; the reverse conversion is exact.
- Expression `as` is reserved for creating `dyn Trait` values. Numeric conversions use the integer and floating-point methods above; other non-`dyn` targets are rejected. The separate `as` form in `use package as alias;` still selects an import alias.

There are no exponentiation, null coalescing or user-defined operators.

### range expression

`start..end` constructs an incrementing half-open `FnIterator[isize]`, and `start..=end` constructs an inclusive iterator. Both can be used directly in `for`:

```goml
for value in 0..10 {
    println(value)
}

for value in 0..=10 {
    println(value)
}
```

Both ends are `isize`. A half-open range is empty when `start >= end`; an inclusive range is empty when `start > end` and contains one value when both ends are equal. Each endpoint is evaluated once from left to right. Inclusive iteration does not compute `end + 1`, so the maximum `isize` endpoint does not overflow. Range expressions cannot be chained. Open ranges, character ranges, and custom step syntax are not supported. The `..` and `..=` in patterns are a separate range-pattern syntax.

## control flow

### `if`

`if` is always an expression.`else` is required when generating non-`unit` values:

```goml
fn absolute(value: i32) -> i32 {
    if value < 0 {
        -value
    } else {
        value
    }
}
```

Both branches must produce compatible types.Conditions with only side effects can omit `else`; in this case the then branch must produce `unit`:

```goml
if enabled {
    println("enabled")
}
```

`else if` is another `if` in the `else` branch:

```goml
let label = if score > 90 {
    "high"
} else if score > 60 {
    "middle"
} else {
    "low"
};
```

`if let` executes the then branch when the pattern match is successful and restricts the pattern binding to that branch.The matched expression is evaluated only once:

```goml
let number = if let Option::Some(value) = candidate {
    value
} else {
    0
};
```

The `else` of `if let` can also be omitted; in this case the compiler treats the else branch as `()`, so the then branch must produce `unit`:

```goml
if let Option::Some(value) = candidate {
    println(value);
};
```

When you need to get values ​​from two branches, you must write `else` explicitly.

### `match`

```goml
fn unwrap_or(value: Option[i32], fallback: i32) -> i32 {
    match value {
        Some(inner) => inner,
        None => fallback,
    }
}
```

The matched expression is evaluated only once, and the pattern is tried from top to bottom.All branches must produce compatible types, and the compiler is required to cover all possible values.

An unqualified variant in a pattern is resolved only against the matched value's type.The compiler does not search unrelated enums for a fallback.If that type is not an enum, does not contain the variant, or cannot be inferred, the pattern is rejected.Fully qualified patterns remain available:

```goml
match value {
    Option::Some(inner) => inner,
    Option::None => fallback,
}
```

The rule is shared by `match`, `if let`, `while let`, `let`, `for`, nested patterns, and or-patterns.Existing refutability requirements still apply to `let` and `for`.

Branches can be guarded.guard must be a `bool`, and bindings introduced by this branching pattern can be used:

```goml
match value {
    Option::Some(inner) if inner > 0 => inner,
    Option::Some(_) => 0,
    Option::None => -1,
}
```

guard only evaluates after a successful pattern match.Branches with ordinary guards are not counted in exhaustive coverage; only branches without guards and branches with guard literal `true` provide coverage.Branches with guard literal `false` are unreachable.The compiler also warns about branches that are completely covered by earlier patterns.

A branch body can be a single expression or a block.Different branches must be separated by commas, and the comma in the last branch can be omitted:

```goml
match value {
    Option::Some(inner) => {
        let doubled = inner * 2;
        doubled
    },
    Option::None => 0,
}
```

### `select`

`select` waits for one channel operation that can proceed and evaluates that arm as the value of the expression:

```goml
let outcome = select {
    recv(messages) as message => match message {
        Some(value) => "received " + value,
        None => "messages closed",
    },
    send(events, "ready") => "sent",
    default => "not ready",
};
```

A receive arm has the form `recv(channel) as binding => body`. The channel must have type `Channel[T]` or `Receiver[T]`, and the binding has type `Option[T]`; a closed and drained channel selects immediately and supplies `None`. Write `_` when the received value and close state are not needed. A send arm has the form `send(channel, value) => body`, accepts `Channel[T]` or `Sender[T]`, and requires the value to match the channel element type.

Communication arms may have a `when` guard after their operands. Operands and guards are evaluated exactly once in source order. A false guard disables its arm by selecting on a nil directional channel; if every arm is disabled, a select without `default` blocks and one with `default` runs immediately. The receive binding is not in scope in its guard.

```goml
select {
    recv(messages) when accepting match {
        Some(Event::Data { id, value }) => handle(id, value),
        Some(Event::Stop) | None => stop(),
    },
    send(events, "ready") when publishing => published(),
    default => idle(),
}
```

`recv(channel) match { ... }` exhaustively matches the `Option[T]` result after communication succeeds. It is equivalent to receiving into a fresh binding and applying an ordinary `match`, so contextual variants, nested patterns, or-patterns, and exhaustiveness checking work normally. A refutable pattern cannot directly replace the receive binding because discarding a received value after a pattern failure would lose data invisibly.

`select priority` is a deterministic non-blocking form. It requires one final `default`, probes communication arms from first to last, chooses the first arm that can complete immediately, and otherwise runs `default`. False guards are skipped. Ordinary `select` retains Go's unspecified choice among simultaneously ready operations.

Every `select` contains at least one `recv` or `send` arm. It may have one `default` arm, which must be last. Without `default`, execution blocks until an operation can proceed. With `default`, that arm runs immediately when no communication arm is ready. When several operations are ready, the selected arm is unspecified.

Channel operands, send values, and guards are evaluated exactly once from top to bottom before selection. Arm bodies are evaluated only after their operation is chosen, receive bindings are visible only in their own bodies, and all bodies must produce compatible types. A body may be a single expression or a block. Arms are comma-separated, with an optional final comma. `select`, `priority`, `recv`, `send`, `when`, `match`, and `default` are contextual spellings in these positions rather than globally reserved identifiers.

`select` is a runtime operation and is unavailable in `comptime` evaluation. Cancellation, task completion, and timers participate through `Receiver[unit]` values rather than dedicated select-arm syntax.

### `while`

```goml
let mut index = 0;
while index < limit {
    index = index + 1;
};
```

The condition must be `bool` and the loop result is `unit`. A `while` loop accepts only `break` without a value.

`while let` evaluates the right-hand expression once in each round; when the match is successful, it enters the loop body and provides pattern binding, and when the match fails, it exits the loop:

```goml
while let Option::Some(value) = iterator.next() {
    println(value);
};
```

The loop body must return `unit`.Pattern binding is only visible within the loop body.

### `loop`

`loop` repeats a block until control leaves it. Unlike `while` and `for`, it is an expression whose result comes from `break`:

```goml
let result = loop {
    let candidate = next();
    if candidate >= 0 {
        break candidate;
    };
};
```

All `break` values targeting the same `loop` must have compatible types. `break;` supplies `unit`, so it cannot be mixed with non-`unit` break values. A `loop` with no `break` targeting it has type `never` and does not continue to the following expression. Unlabeled `break` and `continue` target the nearest loop.

### `for`

```goml
let values: Vec[i32] = Vec::new();
values.push(10);
values.push(20);

for value in values {
    println(value);
};
```

`for pattern in source { ... }` accepts fixed arrays and values ​​that implement `IntoIterator`.Both the source expression and the `into_iter` transformation are executed only once.The pattern must be irrefutable and the loop body must return `unit`.`start..end` can be used directly as a native `isize` range.

Tuple destructuring can be used directly in loops:

```goml
for (key, value) in pairs {
    println(key + value.to_string());
};
```

Fixed arrays use a native indexed loop. `Vec[T]`, `Slice[T]` and all `Iterator` values have corresponding `IntoIterator` implementations.

### `break`, `continue` and `return`

```goml
while true {
    if done {
        break
    } else {
        continue
    };
};
```

`break` and `continue` can only appear in loops. `continue` never has a value. `break value` is allowed only for `loop`; `while` and `for` accept `break;` only. Both are divergent control expressions and can appear in `if`, `match`, or other value positions.

Rust-style labels select an enclosing `while`, `loop`, or `for` without conflicting with `break value`:

```goml
'outer: for row in rows {
    for item in row {
        if found(item) {
            break 'outer;
        } else {
            continue;
        }
    }
}

let answer = 'result: loop {
    break 'result 42;
};
```

`continue 'label;` resumes the selected enclosing loop. `break 'label value;` may carry a value only when the selected target is a `loop`. Labels must refer to an active enclosing loop and cannot be duplicated while an outer label of the same name is active. Crossing one or more blocks still runs their `defer` cleanups from inner to outer before control reaches the target.

`return` can be taken with or without a value and checks the return type of the current function or closure:

```goml
fn first_positive(values: Vec[i32]) -> i32 {
    for value in values {
        if value > 0 {
            return value
        } else {
            ()
        };
    };
    -1
}
```

### `?`

The suffix `?` only supports the built-in semantics `Option[T]` and `Result[T, E]`:

```goml
fn plus_one(value: Option[i32]) -> Option[i32] {
    Option::Some(value? + 1)
}

fn read_number(flag: bool) -> Result[i32, string] {
    let value = parse_number(flag)?;
    Result::Ok(value)
}
```

When using `?` with `Option[T]`, the nearest function or closure must return `Option[_]`.Use of `Result[T, E]` must return `Result[_, E]` with the same error type; there is currently no Rust `From`-style error conversion.`?` will evaluate the operand once.

### `go`

`go` starts a zero-argument closure that returns `unit`:

```goml
go || {
    println("background")
};
```

Don't write `go work();`; that will get `unit` first, and the value type required by `go` is `() -> unit`.Should be written `go || work();` .

`go` is a detached, unstructured escape hatch. Its lifetime is not tied to the caller, it does not return a task handle, and its failures are not propagated. Use `std::task` when the caller must wait for child work or coordinate cancellation.

The `unstructured_go` lint warns on each `go` expression. A function or method that intentionally owns detached background work can use `#[allow(unstructured_go)]`.

## model

Patterns can be used with `let`, `for`, `match`, `if let` and `while let`.

| model | Example |
| --- | --- |
| variable binding | `value` |
| Wildcard | `_` |
| unit | `()` |
| bool/number/string/character | `true`、`42`、`"ok"`、`'x'` |
| top-level constant | `ANSWER` or `config::ANSWER` |
| Group | `(pattern)` |
| tuple | `(left, right)` |
| Single element tuple | `(value,)` |
| exact structure | `Point { x, y: other }` |
| partial structure | `Point { x, .. }` |
| newtype | `UserId(inner)` |
| Enum unit variant | `Color::Red` or contextual `Red` |
| Enum tuple variant | `Option::Some(value)` or contextual `Some(value)` |
| Enum struct-like variant | `Message::Named { value }` or contextual `Named { value }` |
| Array, Vec or Slice | `[first, second]`、`[first, .., last]` |
| rest binding | `[first, middle @ .., last]` |
| Alias | `whole @ Option::Some(value)` |
| or-pattern | `Color::Red \| Color::Blue` |
| scope | `0..10`、`'a'..='z'` |
| Nested mode | `Result::Ok((key, value))` |

### Rebuttability and binding

`let` and `for` require that the pattern be irrefutable, that is, the type at that position must succeed.`match`, `if let` and `while let` can use rebuttable patterns:

```goml
let (left, right) = pair;

if let Option::Some(value) = candidate {
    println(value);
};
```

Irrefutability is judged jointly by type and sub-pattern rather than by surface syntax alone.For example, the destructuring of a single-variant enum is irrefutable, as is the complete destructuring of a fixed-length array of known length; [first, ..] of a Vec[T] may fail with an empty Vec.

Variables with the same name cannot be bound repeatedly in the same pattern branch.Each alternative of the or-pattern must be bound to exactly the same set of variables, and the corresponding variables must be of the same type:

```goml
match value {
    Either::Left(shared) | Either::Right(shared) => shared,
}
```

Pattern binding is only visible in the corresponding `let` subsequent scope, `for` / `while let` loop body, `if let` then branch, or `match` branch guard and branch body.

### Groups, tuples, structures and enumerations

`(pattern)` only changes the pattern combination method, `(pattern,)` is the single-element tuple pattern:

```goml
let (only,) = one_tuple;

match candidate {
    (Option::Some(value)) => value,
    Option::None => 0,
}
```

Structure field patterns support abbreviations with the same name:

```goml
let Point { x, y } = point;
```

Struct mode is exact by default and all fields must be listed.Unlisted fields can be ignored using the trailing `..`:

```goml
let Point { x, .. } = point;
```

`..` appears at most once in the structure pattern and must be the last item.Duplicate fields, unknown fields, and missing fields without writing `..` will all generate diagnoses.

The number of constructor parameters of the enumeration pattern must be consistent with the definition.An unqualified variant is resolved from the expected enum type rather than from global uniqueness.For example, `Shared` in a pattern for `First` means `First::Shared` even when `Second::Shared` also exists.If `First` has no `Shared` variant, the compiler reports that error instead of selecting `Second::Shared`.Type aliases and imported enum types participate after normalization.Nested variant payloads supply the expected type for nested patterns.

### Fixed arrays, Vec and Slice

Fixed arrays `[T; N]`, `Vec[T]` and `Slice[T]` share square bracket mode.Without `..`, the pattern requires the exact length; with `..`, the prefix and suffix only specify the minimum length:

```goml
match values {
    [] => "empty",
    [only] => "one",
    [first, .., last] => "many",
}
```

There is at most one rest in a sequence pattern.rest can be located anywhere, or it can be written as `name @ ..` to bind the middle part:

```goml
let values: [i32; 4] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let [first, middle @ .., last] = values;
```

For fixed arrays, the number of elements must be exactly equal to `N` when rest is omitted; when rest is included, the total number of elements of explicit prefixes and suffixes cannot exceed `N`.In the above example, the type of `middle` is `[i32; 2]`.

For `Vec[T]` and `Slice[T]`, the binding type of `name @ ..` is read-only `Slice[T]`.For example `[head, tail @ ..]` requires at least one element, `tail` will not be copied into a new Vec.Since dynamic sequences may not be long enough, such patterns are usually placed inside a `match`, `if let` or `while let`.

### Alias ​​and or-pattern

`name @ pattern` binds the entire matched value to `name` while continuing to match the inner pattern:

```goml
match value {
    whole @ Option::Some(inner) => use_both(whole, inner),
    Option::None => fallback(),
}
```

`@` is more tightly bound than `|`.Therefore `whole @ A | B` resolves to `(whole @ A) | B`, and usually an error will be reported because the variables bound to the two alternatives are different.To make the alias cover the entire or-pattern, you must write parentheses:

```goml
whole @ (Either::Left(value) | Either::Right(value))
```

or-pattern is tried from left to right and can be nested in tuple, struct, enumeration and sequence patterns.

### range mode

`start..end` does not contain an upper bound, `start..=end` contains an upper bound:

```goml
match character {
    'a'..='z' => "lowercase",
    'A'..='Z' => "uppercase",
    _ => "other",
}
```

Both endpoints must be integer or character literals of the same concrete type.Signed integer endpoints can be negative.The exclusive range requires the lower bound to be strictly less than the upper bound, and the inclusive range requires the lower bound to be less than or equal to the upper bound.Open ranges, floating point ranges, or string ranges are not currently supported; separate `..` in sequences and structures is a rest, not a range.

### Exhaustiveness and unreachable branches

The compiler checks whether `match` is exhausted by the actual type of the pattern, and gives examples of missing patterns if it is not.The analysis covers bool, enumerations, tuples, structures, fixed arrays, Vec/Slice, integer and character ranges, aliases and or-patterns, and will also warn about branches that are never matched.

An empty `match` is only valid for types that have no constructible value:

```goml
enum Never {}

fn absurd(value: Never) -> i32 {
    match value {}
}
```

Exhaustive analysis ignores enumeration variants with no value for the payload type and also identifies purely recursive enumerations with no base variant.For example, `enum MaybeNever { Empty, Filled(Never) }` just overrides `Empty`; `enum Loop { Next(Loop) }` has no constructible value.

Branches with normal guards do not provide exhaustive coverage because guard may be false; subsequent unguarded branches are usually required.String and floating-point literals cannot enumerate the entire type, and `_` is also usually required when matching these types.In floating point mode, `-0.0` and `0.0` are regarded as the same value.

There are no `ref` or `ref mut` patterns. `mut name` is supported for individual bindings, while pattern matching on `dyn Trait` is not supported.

## Closures and function values

### closure syntax

```goml
let add = |left: i32, right: i32| left + right;
let increment = |value: i32| {
    value + 1
};
let greet = || println("hello");
```

Closure parameter types can be inferred from the expected function type or the calling location; when inference is unstable, it should be explicitly marked:

```goml
let transform: (i32) -> string = |value| value.to_string();
```

Closures can capture external variables or modify captured `let mut`:

```goml
let mut count = 0;
let next = || {
    count = count + 1;
    count
};
```

`return` in a closure returns the closure, not the outer function.

### No let-polymorphism

Each closure and local function value has only one concrete type:

```goml
let identity = |value| value;
let number = identity(1);
```

The `string` cannot be processed with the same `identity` thereafter.Define top-level generic functions when polymorphism is required:

```goml
fn identity[T](value: T) -> T {
    value
}
```

Top-level functions, closures, and loaded enumeration constructors can all be passed or returned as function values.
Closures can be nested and return another closure that captures the environment, but each resulting closure expression still has only one concrete function type.

## trait and impl

### Define traits

Trait method signatures must include parameter names.The first receiver can be written as `self`, which is short for `self: Self`:

```goml
trait Render {
    fn render(self) -> string;
}

trait Convert[T] {
    fn convert(self, fallback: T) -> T;
}
```

A trait may also declare an associated function without a receiver. `Self` is inferred from its arguments or the expected return type:

```goml
trait Decode {
    fn decode(input: string) -> Self;
}

trait Default {
    fn default() -> Self;
}

fn decode_value[T: Decode](input: string) -> T {
    Decode::decode(input)
}

fn default_value[T: Default]() -> T {
    Default::default()
}
```

An impl method must preserve whether the trait declaration has a `self: Self` receiver. Associated functions use static dispatch, cannot be called with method syntax, and do not participate in `dyn` dispatch. If neither arguments nor the expected result determine `Self`, the call is rejected as ambiguous.

Traits can have supertraits, generic constraints, and associated types:

```goml
trait Provider: Render {
    type Item: ToString;

    fn get(self) -> Self::Item;
}
```

Associated type projections may be chained when every step is constrained by its declaring trait. For example, `I::IntoIter::Item` projects `IntoIter` from `I`, then projects `Item` from that iterator type. Chained projections can appear in signatures and `where` equalities:

```goml
trait IntoIterator
where
    Self::Item = Self::IntoIter::Item,
{
    type Item;
    type IntoIter: Iterator;
}
```

Generic trait example:

```goml
trait Child[T: ToString]: Parent[T] + Render
where
    T: Eq,
{
    fn child(self) -> string;
}
```

The standard comparison hierarchy follows the distinction between partial comparison and total equivalence:

```goml
trait PartialEq {
    fn eq(self: Self, other: Self) -> bool;
}

trait Eq: PartialEq {}

trait PartialOrd: PartialEq {
    fn partial_cmp(self: Self, other: Self) -> Option[Ordering];
}

trait Ord: Eq + PartialOrd {
    fn cmp(self: Self, other: Self) -> Ordering;
}
```

`Eq` is a marker trait and has no methods. Equality behavior belongs in `PartialEq`; a total-equivalence type implements `PartialEq` with `fn eq` and adds an empty `impl Eq`. `Eq::eq` and an `eq` method inside `impl Eq` are invalid.

Trait methods may provide a default body. An impl may omit such a method and will inherit the default; an explicitly declared impl method overrides it. Default bodies are checked using the trait's generic parameters, predicates, associated types, and `Self`, and remain available across package boundaries:

```goml
trait Named {
    fn name(self) -> string;

    fn describe(self) -> string {
        "named:" + self.name()
    }
}

impl Named for Point {
    fn name(self) -> string {
        "point"
    }
}
```

Trait methods may also declare their own type parameters and constraints:

```goml
trait Convert {
    fn convert[U: ToString](self, fallback: U) -> string;
}
```

The corresponding impl method must have the same method-generic arity, signature, and constraints. Generic trait methods use static dispatch and make the trait unavailable as `dyn`.

### trait impl

```goml
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Render for Point {
    fn render(self: Point) -> string {
        self.x.to_string() + "," + self.y.to_string()
    }
}
```

The type parameters of generic impl are written after `impl`:

```goml
impl[T: ToString] Render for Box[T] {
    fn render(self: Box[T]) -> string {
        self.value.to_string()
    }
}
```

Different applications of generic traits are different impl:

```goml
impl Convert[i32] for Token {
    fn convert(self: Token, fallback: i32) -> i32 {
        7
    }
}

impl Convert[string] for Token {
    fn convert(self: Token, fallback: string) -> string {
        "seven"
    }
}
```

Associated types are bound in impl:

```goml
impl Iterator for Counter {
    type Item = i32;

    fn next(self: Counter) -> Option[i32] {
        next_value(self)
    }
}
```

When implementing a trait with supertraits, you also need to provide the impl of the target type for each supertrait.The compiler rejects overlapping impls and enforces the orphan rule: at least one of the trait or the nominal type being implemented must belong to the current package.The target nominal type of intrinsic impl must belong to the current package.

### intrinsic impl

```goml
impl Point {
    fn new(x: i32, y: i32) -> Self {
        Point { x, y }
    }

    fn sum(self: Self) -> i32 {
        self.x + self.y
    }
}
```

The associated function without a receiver is called with `Point::new(1, 2)`; the method whose first parameter is the receiver can be called with `point.sum()` or `Point::sum(point)`.

Intrinsic impl of generic types:

```goml
impl[T] Box[T] {
    fn get(self: Self) -> T {
        self.value
    }

    fn map[U](self: Self, map_fn: (T) -> U) -> Box[U] {
        Box { value: map_fn(self.value) }
    }
}
```

Method type arguments are normally inferred. Write `box_value.map::[string](convert)` when explicit arguments are needed, or `Box::[i32]::map::[string](box_value, convert)` in associated form.

### Method parsing and UFCS

For specific values, use:

```goml
value.render()
Render::render(value)
```

Cross-package method syntax requires that the trait be in the method scope of the current file:

```goml
use acme::render;
use render::Render;
```

If multiple visible traits define methods with the same name, `value.render()` will be ambiguous.Use UFCS to explicitly select:

```goml
let a = A::render(value);
let b = B::render(value);
```

Generic trait UFCS uses `::[...]` after the trait name to give the type parameters:

```goml
let number = Convert::[i32]::convert(token, 0);
let text = Convert::[string]::convert(token, "");
```

Trait bounds for type parameters make the corresponding methods available for generic values.supertrait and associated type bound will also participate in parsing as implicit constraints.

## `dyn Trait`

Use `as dyn Trait` to convert a concrete value that satisfies a dyn-safe trait into a trait object:

```goml
trait Display {
    fn show(self) -> string;
}

fn erase[T: Display](value: T) -> dyn Display {
    value as dyn Display
}

fn show_dynamic(value: dyn Display) -> string {
    value.show()
}
```

Concrete values are never boxed implicitly when a `dyn Trait` value is expected. Assignments, arguments, returns, branches, constructors, and collection operations must place `as dyn Trait` at the conversion site. Existing `dyn Trait` values can still flow through compatible typed contexts without another conversion.

The `dyn` value supports method syntax, and UFCS can also be used; it can be seen that supertrait methods are also available:

```goml
value.show()
Display::show(value)
```

Associated types are fixed in square brackets and are available to dyn-dispatched method signatures:

```goml
trait Source {
    type Item;

    fn get(self: Self) -> Self::Item;
}

fn read(source: dyn Source[Item = isize]) -> isize {
    source.get()
}
```

Every associated type declared by the trait must be bound exactly once. The bracket grammar reserves positional trait arguments followed by associated bindings, such as `dyn Consumer[string, Error = IoError]`; positional arguments after the first `Name = Type` binding are rejected. Generic trait objects are still rejected, so the positional form is reserved for forward compatibility rather than enabled today.

Current dyn-safe conditions:

- Traits cannot have type parameters;
- Each method must have a first receiver parameter of exactly type `Self`;
- Direct `Self` cannot appear in other parameters or return types, while a bound projection such as `Self::Item` is allowed;
- Methods cannot declare type parameters.

Current limitations:

- Generic trait object is not supported;
- Multiple bounds such as `dyn Read + Close` are parsed for forward compatibility but rejected by the type checker;
- Pattern matching on `dyn Trait` is not supported.

## Properties and Derivations

User source code supports deriving `ToString`, `Debug`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `PartialOrd`, `Ord`, `Hash`, and `Default` for structures and enumerations, including generic types. `Serialize` and `Deserialize` are also available after importing them from `std::serde` or a re-exporting format package:

```goml
#[derive(ToString, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash, Default)]
struct Key {
    name: string,
    version: i32,
}

#[derive(ToString, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash, Default)]
enum Entry[T, Marker] {
    Empty,
    Value(Vec[T]),
}
```

All fields or variant payloads used by a derive must support that trait. For a generic definition, the generated impl constrains each distinct participating field or payload type that mentions a type parameter. An unused phantom parameter receives no constraint. Compiler-owned runtime, intrinsic, and lang-item attributes remain unavailable to ordinary projects. User projects may use the `go_ffi` attribute described in the next section.

The eight prelude derives are supplied by verified handlers in the toolchain's builtin sources. They are not hard-coded code generators in the compiler. Standard-library and third-party derives use the same handler and artifact mechanism, but they are not added to the prelude: import the trait or its package before using the derive name.

Derived `Debug` provides `Debug::debug(value)` and the `.debug()` method. It formats structs with their type and field names and enums with their type and variant names. Primitive field values use their ordinary textual representation, while nested values recursively use `Debug`.

`PartialEq` compares struct fields in declaration order and compares enum variants and payloads structurally. `Eq` generates only the marker implementation and does not implicitly derive `PartialEq`. The usual total-equivalence spelling is therefore `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]`.

`PartialOrd` and `Ord` use lexicographic field order. Enum variants are ordered by declaration order, followed by their payload fields. `PartialOrd` immediately propagates `None`; `Ord` returns a definite `Ordering`. Neither derive implicitly generates its supertraits, so the usual total-order spelling is `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord)]`.

`Hash` combines fields in declaration order and includes the enum variant discriminant. It can be derived independently, although hash-map keys still require both `Eq` and `Hash`.

`Default` initializes every struct field with `Default::default()`. For an enum it always selects the first declared variant and recursively defaults that variant's tuple or named payload. An empty enum cannot derive `Default`. Reordering enum variants therefore changes both the derived default value and the derived ordering; the first version does not support `#[default]`.

### Programmable derive

A dependency package may export a compile-time derive handler:

```goml
package labels;

pub trait Label {
    fn label(self: Self) -> string;
}

#[comptime_derive(Label)]
pub fn derive_label(input: DeriveInput) -> DeriveOutput {
    let output = derive_output_new(input, "Label");
    let params = meta_param_list_new();
    meta_param_list_push(params, "self", derive_target_type(input));
    let body = meta_expr_string(derive_item_name(input));
    let method = meta_method("label", params, meta_type_call_site("string"), body);
    derive_output_add_method(output, method);
    output
}
```

Another package applies the handler through an imported package path:

```goml
use alice::labels as labels;
use labels::Label;

#[derive(Label)]
struct User {
    name: string,
}

#[derive(labels::Label)]
struct Group {
    name: string,
}
```

A public `#[comptime_derive(Name)]` handler exports the derive name `Name`, independently of its implementation function name. Export names are unique within one package and cannot contain `::`. The named form requires `pub`; private `#[comptime_derive]` functions remain implementation helpers. The unnamed public form remains available and exports the handler function's short name.

Derive names have their own namespace, but ordinary `use` declarations populate it alongside the type and trait namespaces. For example, after `use std::serde;`, `use serde::Serialize;` makes both the `Serialize` trait and a derive export named `Serialize` available as `Serialize`, so `#[derive(Serialize)]` works without another import form. An import alias applies to both namespaces: `use serde::Serialize as DataSerialize;` permits `#[derive(DataSerialize)]`. A package import permits the qualified spelling `#[derive(serde::Serialize)]`. Public re-exports preserve the derive handler's definition identity, so facade packages can use `pub use` to expose a standard-library or third-party derive without copying its implementation.

`std::serde` owns the format-independent `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `Serializer`, and `Deserializer` traits and the two derives. Typed formats use `Serialize::serialize` and `Deserialize::deserialize`: the format handle is a method-level generic parameter, so monomorphization produces ordinary static calls without a runtime serializer trait object, Go interface dispatch, or runtime reflection. A derived struct emits fields directly and a derived enum emits its declaration index, wire name, shape, and payload directly. Derived named-field decoding accepts arbitrary field order, skips unknown fields, and rejects duplicate or missing fields. Struct fields, enum variants, and named variant fields support `#[serde(rename = "wire_name")]`.

`serde::Value` remains the explicit dynamic data model. It retains exact signed and unsigned integer widths, floating-point widths, enum declaration indexes, field order, and variant shape. `Sequence`, `Tuple`, and `Optional` are distinct, and `Value::Number(string)` represents a textual number whose destination type is not yet known. `serde::to_value` and `serde::from_value` connect typed values to this model through `ValueSerializer` and `ValueDeserializer`; both return `Result`, and using them intentionally constructs or consumes a complete value tree. Unit, booleans, strings, chars, numeric primitives, `Value`, `Vec[T]`, `Option[T]`, and two- or three-element tuples have standard direct implementations.

`Serialize` and `Deserialize` have no `Value` fallback methods and `Deserialize` does not require a runtime schema. Handwritten implementations must implement the generic direct protocol. `Schema` remains available only for explicit dynamic operations such as `bincode::decode_value`; it is not derived or consulted by typed decoding.

This design removes the mandatory intermediate tree, but it is not an absolute zero-cost or Rust-style zero-copy guarantee. GoML has GC rather than ownership and `Deserialize<'de>` lifetimes, format buffers and decoded strings still allocate when required, and the Go compiler decides which static calls it inlines. The direct path means no data-model tree or dynamic dispatch is inherently required; allocations must still be measured for each format and value shape.

```goml
use std::serde;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct User {
    #[serde(rename = "display_name")]
    name: string,
    active: bool,
}
```

`std::json` supports two deliberately separate modes. The value mode uses `json::Value`, `json::parse`, and `json::encode` for schema-free inspection and editing. JSON numbers remain their exact source text in `Value::Number`. In the typed mode, `json::to_string` and `from_string` write and consume JSON directly through the streaming serde traits; neither operation first builds a `json::Value` or `serde::Value` tree. `json::to_value` and `from_value` return `Result` and are the explicit bridge to the dynamic JSON model. Numeric range and destination-width checks happen while deserializing into the requested type. `json::try_to_string` and `try_stringify` return serialization errors; the older infallible `to_string` and `stringify` signatures remain compatibility wrappers and return an empty string on such an error.

`json` publicly re-exports the shared `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits and derive handlers, so either `use serde::Serialize` or `use json::Serialize` selects the same implementation identity. The JSON serializer emits struct fields in source order. Direct maps use JSON objects and therefore require keys whose direct representation is a string or char; `try_to_string` returns a recoverable error for other key types. The deserializer accepts any field order, recursively skips unknown values, rejects duplicate and missing fields, and rejects trailing input. Typed errors retain the byte offset and nested struct, sequence, map, or enum path. JSON uses externally tagged enums: a unit variant is a string, a tuple variant is an object whose value is an array, and a struct-like variant is an object whose value is another object. `json::stringify` remains an alias of `json::to_string`.

```goml
use std::json;
use std::math;
use json::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct User {
    name: string,
    active: bool,
}

fn encode_user(value: User) -> string {
    json::to_string(value)
}

fn decode_user(input: string) -> Result[User, string] {
    json::from_string(input)
}
```

A qualified custom derive must have the form `package_alias::export_name`, where `package_alias` is introduced by a `use` in the same source file. A bare library derive must be explicitly imported. Unimported canonical package paths and handlers visible only through a transitive dependency are rejected. If two explicit imports or a prelude derive and an explicit import provide the same bare name, the compiler reports ambiguity and requires a qualified name or import alias.

`#[comptime_derive]` and `#[comptime_derive(Name)]` are valid only on non-generic free functions. A public handler must have the exact signature `(DeriveInput) -> DeriveOutput`. Private functions with the unnamed attribute are compile-time-only helpers and are included in the interface when reachable from a public handler. A derive handler may call those helpers and ordinary `#[comptime]` functions, but it cannot be called from runtime code or ordinary value `comptime`. Derive handlers are not exported as runtime functions.

The first version resolves handlers from already compiled dependency interfaces. A handler cannot be defined and applied within the same package compilation. Put reusable handlers and their generated traits in a separate package. The target may be a generic struct or enum; the generated impl inherits its type parameters. `derive_output_add_predicate` and `derive_output_add_call_site_predicate` add the bounds required by generated methods.

The input reflection operations are:

```text
derive_item_name(input) -> string
derive_item_kind(input) -> isize
derive_generic_count(input) -> isize
derive_generic_name(input, index) -> string
derive_field_count/name/type(...)
derive_variant_count/name(...)
derive_variant_kind(input, variant) -> isize
derive_variant_field_count/name/type(...)
derive_attribute_count/name/text(...)
derive_field_attribute_count/name/text(...)
derive_variant_attribute_count/name/text(...)
derive_variant_field_attribute_count/name/text(...)
derive_attribute(input, index) -> MetaAttribute
derive_field_attribute(input, field, index) -> MetaAttribute
derive_variant_attribute(input, variant, index) -> MetaAttribute
derive_variant_field_attribute(input, variant, field, index) -> MetaAttribute
derive_target_type(input) -> MetaType
derive_fresh_name(input, prefix) -> string
```

`derive_item_kind` returns zero for a struct and one for an enum. `derive_variant_kind` returns zero for a unit variant, one for a tuple variant, and two for a struct-like variant. The count operation for a nested attribute takes the owner indexes; its name and text operations take one additional attribute index. Field operations require a struct, while variant operations require an enum. Invalid kinds and indexes are compile-time errors at the `#[derive(...)]` site. Attributes may be attached to struct fields, enum variants, and tuple or named variant fields. `name` returns the attribute name and `text` returns its complete source spelling.

The structured attribute handle exposes `meta_attribute_name`, `meta_attribute_text`, `meta_attribute_has_argument_list`, `meta_attribute_argument_count`, `meta_attribute_argument_kind`, `meta_attribute_argument_name`, `meta_attribute_argument_value_kind`, and `meta_attribute_argument_text`. Argument kind is `ident`, `path`, `string`, or `named`. Named arguments use `name = value`, where the value may be an identifier, path, or string. `argument_name` returns the left-hand name, `argument_value_kind` describes the right-hand value, and `argument_text` returns its decoded value.

The structured output API provides opaque `MetaAttribute`, `MetaType`, `MetaExpr`, `MetaPattern`, `MetaArm`, `MetaBlock`, `MetaParamList`, `MetaGenericList`, `MetaMethod`, and list handles. Constructors use the `meta_type_*`, `meta_expr_*`, `meta_pattern_*`, `meta_arm*`, `meta_block_*`, `meta_param_list_*`, and `meta_generic_list_*` families. `meta_method` creates a concrete trait method; `meta_method_generic` creates a method with explicit type parameters and bounds. A handler creates its single result with `derive_output_new` or `derive_output_new_call_site`, adds trait predicates and methods, and returns it.

The builder operations are:

```

`meta_expr_unary` uses operator numbers `0..2` for `-`, `!`, and `~`. `meta_expr_binary` uses operator numbers `0..17` for `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, `&&`, `||`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=`, respectively. `meta_expr_integer` accepts a normalized integer literal string plus its exact integer type, so builders can represent values outside the host `isize` range. `meta_expr_cast` accepts only a `dyn` target type; generated numeric conversions should use `meta_expr_method_call`. `meta_expr_trait_call` resolves the trait in the handler's defining package and builds a static trait method call. `meta_type_equal` compares structural type identity. `meta_type_kind` returns `primitive`, `named`, `tuple`, `application`, `array`, `function`, or `dyn`; shape-specific accessors reject other kinds. List handles are mutable only through their matching `push` operation and remain local to one derive evaluation.

Unqualified names passed to `derive_output_new`, `derive_output_add_predicate`, `meta_type_named`, `meta_expr_call`, and `meta_generic_list_add_bound` resolve in the handler's defining package. Their `_call_site` variants resolve in the target package. `derive_fresh_name` should be used for generated local bindings that must not collide with user names. The `*_target_*` builders construct or match the annotated item by compiler identity and should be preferred over spelling its name manually.

The result is restricted to one trait `impl` for the annotated type. It cannot create types, traits, functions, constants, modules, imports, inherent impls, extern declarations, attributes, associated types, or raw tokens. Generated method type parameters and trait bounds are supported. The generated impl is processed by ordinary name resolution, orphan and coherence checks, type checking, monomorphization, and backend lowering. Duplicate or invalid generated implementations are regular compiler diagnostics.

Handlers are deterministic and have no host access. Imported derive CTIR is verified as untrusted artifact data. Evaluation uses the ordinary compile-time limits plus a limit of 100,000 metadata and syntax-builder operations. Failures are anchored to the requesting derive attribute and include the compile-time derive call stack.

## Go FFI

The typed Go FFI binds a top-level GoML declaration to an exported package-level Go function:

```goml
#[go_ffi("strings", "ToUpper")]
extern fn to_upper(value: string) -> string;

#[go_ffi("strings", "Cut")]
extern fn cut(value: string, separator: string) -> (string, string, bool);

fn example() -> string {
    let (before, after, found) = cut("left:right", ":");
    if found { to_upper(before + after) } else { "" }
}
```

The first attribute argument is the Go import path and the second is an exported ASCII Go identifier. The GoML function name is local and may differ from the Go symbol. Add `pub` before `extern fn` to expose the binding through another GoML package; interface and Core artifacts preserve the Go import path and symbol.

The initial ABI supports values whose generated Go representations are already directly assignable:

| GoML type | Go representation |
| --- | --- |
| `bool`, numeric primitives, `string` | Corresponding Go primitive |
| `char` | `rune` / `int32` |
| `byte` | `byte` / `uint8` |
| `[T; N]` | `[N]T` |
| `Slice[T]` | `[]T` |
| `Channel[T]` | `chan T` |
| `Sender[T]` | `chan<- T` |
| `Receiver[T]` | `<-chan T` |
| Direct `dyn Marker` parameter or single return | Go `any` through the trait object's `data` field |
| `unit` return | Go function with no result |
| `(A, B, ...)` return | Multiple Go results in the same order |

Tuple types are supported only as the complete return type. Tuple elements and array, slice, or channel elements must themselves be FFI-safe. Parameters cannot be `unit`.

`dyn Marker` is supported only as a direct parameter or as the complete single return type. `Marker` must be strictly empty: it cannot declare generic parameters, predicates, supertraits, associated types, or methods, and the `dyn` type cannot have arguments, associated-type bindings, or additional bounds. The wrapper passes the object's `data` field to Go as `any` and wraps a returned Go value back into the empty marker object. Empty marker objects are not yet supported inside tuples, arrays, slices, or channels.

The declaration must be monomorphic and must describe the Go function exactly. GoML does not inspect Go package type information during type checking; the Go compiler is the final authority for symbol existence and assignability. In particular, a Go named type such as `time.Duration` is not interchangeable with a GoML `i64` parameter even when its underlying representation is the same.

`Vec`, `Ref`, `HashMap`, `Option`, `Result`, user structs and enums, nonempty trait objects, function values, nested tuples, generic declarations, methods, callbacks, automatic Go object lifetime management, and automatic `error` conversion are not supported by this ABI. Write a small Go shim with an exported function and FFI-safe parameters when adapting such an API:

```go
package goshim

import "os"

func ReadText(name string) (string, bool) {
    data, err := os.ReadFile(name)
    return string(data), err == nil
}
```

```goml
#[go_ffi("example.com/myapp/goshim", "ReadText")]
extern fn read_text(name: string) -> (string, bool);
```

When the GoML module root contains `go.mod`, `goml build`, `goml run`, and test linking invoke Go in module mode, so local shim packages and declared Go module dependencies can be imported. Go workspace mode remains disabled. Without `go.mod`, builds retain the existing module-off behavior. Module-mode Go builds always execute and delegate dependency and source freshness to Go's own build cache, so changes to `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and local `.go` shims are observed.

This interface only calls Go from GoML. Exporting GoML functions to Go, calling methods, dynamic symbol lookup, and C ABI interoperation require separate mechanisms.

## test

### Test functions and properties

Top-level functions are marked as tests using `#[test]`:

```goml
package math;

use std::testing;

#[test]
fn addition_works() -> unit {
    testing::assert_eq(1 + 1, 2)
}
```

Test functions must meet the following rules:

- It can only be a top-level function, not an impl method, `extern fn`, structure, enumeration or trait;
- Cannot be named `main`;
- Cannot have parameters or type parameters;
- The return type must be `unit`;
- Canonical test IDs generated within the same test package must be unique.

Test functions do not require `pub`.`#[test]` does not accept parameters.When you need to skip a test by default, you can use `#[ignore]` without parameters or `#[ignore("reason")]` with a string reason; `#[ignore]` cannot be used alone without `#[test]`:

```goml
#[test]
#[ignore]
fn unfinished_case() -> unit {
    ()
}

#[test]
#[ignore("requires an external service")]
fn integration_case() -> unit {
    ()
}
```

`std::testing` provides the following assertions:

- `testing::fail(message)`: Fail the current test immediately;
- `testing::assert(condition)`: requires the condition to be `true`;
- `testing::assert_eq(actual, expected)`: requires two values of the same type that implement `PartialEq + Debug` to be equal;
- `testing::assert_ne(actual, expected)`: requires two values of the same type that implement `PartialEq + Debug` to be unequal.

### White box testing and black box testing

The white-box test file and the source code under test are located in the same package directory. The file name must end with `_test.gom` and declare the same package name:

```text
math/
├── math.gom
└── math_test.gom
```

`math_test.gom`：

```goml
package math;

use std::testing;

#[test]
fn private_helper_works() -> unit {
    testing::assert_eq(private_helper(), 42)
}
```

The test build will merge the production source code and all `*_test.gom` in the same directory into a single package, so white-box testing can access the private top-level items of the package.These files will not participate in compilation when executing normal `goml check`, `goml build` or `goml run` for production targets.

Black-box tests are located in the `tests/` directory of the package under test.This directory as a whole constitutes a package named `tests`. The package under test should be imported explicitly and only its public API can be accessed; nested test suites cannot be created under `tests/`:

```text
math/
├── math.gom
└── tests/
    ├── api_test.gom
    └── smoke_test.gom
```

`math/tests/api_test.gom`：

```goml
package tests;

use alice::myapp::math;
use std::testing;

#[test]
fn public_add_works() -> unit {
    testing::assert_eq(math::add(20, 22), 42)
}
```

If the identity of the package under test is `alice::myapp::math`, the canonical identity of the test package in the above example is `alice::myapp::math::tests`.Ordinary package discovery will exclude the `tests` directory, and production packages cannot import black-box test packages.

### Check and run tests

`goml check`, `goml build` and `goml test` always process complete modules discovered from the current directory upwards, and do not accept package or file targets.`goml check` only checks the production source code by default; using `--tests` will also check all white-box and black-box tests after the production package check is successful:

```sh
goml check
goml check --tests
goml build
goml fmt
goml fmt --check
```

Test source code cannot be used to fix a production package that itself fails inspection.

`goml fmt` formats the current module's production files, internal tests, and black-box test packages using the same package graphs as builds and tests. It can be run from any nested package directory. Package discovery excludes `testdata`, build output, hidden directories, nested modules, and external dependencies. `goml fmt --check` only checks formatting and exits unsuccessfully when any source file would change.

Run the test using:

```sh
goml test [FILTER]
```

`FILTER` performs substring matching on the complete test display name, such as `goml test addition`.Common options include:

- `--kind internal|external|all`: run only white box, only black box or all tests, the default is `all`;
- `--list`: List matching tests without running them;
- `--ignored`: only run ignored tests;
- `--include-ignored`: Run normal tests and ignored tests at the same time;
- `--jobs N`: Number of parallel workers, default is `1`;
- `--timeout 500ms|30s|2m`: timeout for a single test, the default is `30s`;
- `--nocapture`: Let the standard output and standard error of the test directly inherit the terminal;
- `--format text|json`: Select text or line-by-line JSON results; JSON format cannot be used with `--nocapture` at the same time;
- `--target-dir`, `--dry-run` and `--compiler`: have the same meaning as project build commands.

Each test is executed in a separate runner process, and failure to exit and timeout do not affect other tests; `--jobs` controls the number of test processes running at the same time.Executing `goml test` requires an available Go toolchain to build the test runner.

### LSP and editor

LSP will construct the analysis package according to the production file, white box test file and black box test file respectively according to the path, so diagnosis, completion, hover and jump follow the corresponding visibility.`Run Test` CodeLens will appear on the `#[test]` function; the VS Code extension will save the dirty file first, and then call the module-level `goml test` with the complete test name and test type.

The custom `goml/expandedDerive` request returns the formatted AST after built-in and programmable derives have run for the requested document. It uses the same package aliases, explicit derive imports, ambiguity checks, dependency interfaces, CTIR verifier, and resource limits as `goml check`. The VS Code command `GoML: Show Expanded Derive` opens that result beside the source file.

`gomllsp` supports full-document formatting through `textDocument/formatting`. Formatting uses the latest unsaved document text and the fixed rules described in `docs/formatting.md`. Invalid documents are left unchanged.

## Built-in prelude

The toolchain library has three separate layers. `builtin` is the hidden compiler and runtime contract: it owns primitive and built-in type identities, runtime hooks, language items, built-in implementations, and derive handlers. `prelude` is an independently compiled package that depends on `builtin` and defines the public names automatically placed in ordinary source scope. `std` contains normal standard-library packages and is available only through explicit imports.

User and third-party packages cannot explicitly import `builtin` or `prelude`; attempts produce a diagnostic instead of resolving a registry package. This keeps raw runtime helpers and derive internals hidden while preserving the stable identities of re-exported types and traits. Names such as `Option`, `Result`, `Vec`, `ToString`, `print`, `println`, and `range` remain available without `use` through the prelude.

Compiler-recognized protocols are declared in `builtin` with reserved `#[lang(...)]` metadata. The metadata identifies the owning type or trait together with protocol members such as enum variants, associated types, and methods, so compiler behavior does not depend on their public spelling. `#[lang(...)]` is rejected in user, third-party, prelude, and standard-library sources.

The following names can be used without `use`.

### `Option` and `Result`

```goml
enum Option[T] {
    None,
    Some(T),
}

enum Result[T, E] {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

Construction uses `Option::Some`, `Option::None`, `Result::Ok` and `Result::Err`.Patterns may use either those full names or contextual `Some`, `None`, `Ok` and `Err`.

`Option[T]` provides `is_some`, `is_none`, `unwrap_or`, and `unwrap_or_else`, plus type-changing generic methods:

- `value.map(map_fn) -> Option[U]`
- `value.and_then(next) -> Option[U]`
- `value.ok_or(error) -> Result[T, E]`

`Result[T, E]` provides `is_ok`, `is_err`, `unwrap_or`, and `unwrap_or_else`. Its type-changing generic methods are:

- `value.map(map_fn) -> Result[U, E]`
- `value.map_err(map_fn) -> Result[T, F]`
- `value.and_then(next) -> Result[U, E]`

### Output and string conversion

- `print[T: ToString](value: T) -> unit`
- `println[T: ToString](value: T) -> unit`
- `value.to_string() -> string`, suitable for values ​​that implement `ToString`
- `value.debug() -> string`, suitable for values that implement `Debug`
- `string.len() -> isize` and `string.byte_len() -> isize`, both returning the UTF-8 byte length
- `string.get(index: isize) -> char`, decoding a character at a UTF-8 byte boundary
- `string.byte_get(index: isize) -> u8`
- `string.byte_slice(start: isize, end: isize) -> string`
- `string.is_char_boundary(index: isize) -> bool`
- `string.decode_at(index: isize) -> Option[(char, isize)]`
- `string.to_bytes() -> Vec[u8]`
- `string.chars() -> FnIterator[char]`
- `string.char_indices() -> FnIterator[(isize, char)]`
- `string.starts_with(prefix: string) -> bool`
- `string.ends_with(suffix: string) -> bool`
- `string.contains(expected: string) -> bool`
- `string.starts_with_at(start: isize, prefix: string) -> bool`, checking at a byte offset
- `string.find(expected: string) -> Option[isize]`, `string.rfind(expected: string) -> Option[isize]`, and `string.find_bytes(expected: string) -> Option[isize]`, returning byte offsets
- `string.char_count() -> isize`, counting Unicode scalar values
- `string.slice_chars(start: isize, end: isize) -> Option[string]`, using scalar-value indexes
- `string.trim() -> string`, `string.trim_start() -> string`, and `string.trim_end() -> string`, trimming ASCII whitespace
- `string.split(separator: string) -> Vec[string]`, `string.split_once(separator: string) -> Option[(string, string)]`, and `string.lines() -> Vec[string]`
- `string.replace(expected: string, replacement: string) -> string`
- `string.repeat(count: isize) -> string`
- `string.is_ascii() -> bool`
- `string.eq_ignore_ascii_case(other: string) -> bool`
- `string.to_ascii_lowercase() -> string` and `string.to_ascii_uppercase() -> string`

The basic scalar types all implement `ToString` and `Debug`. String concatenation uses `+`.

The key-related traits are the method-bearing `PartialEq::eq(self, other: Self) -> bool`, the marker `Eq: PartialEq`, and `Hash::hash(self) -> u64`. User types can use handwritten impls or derive the corresponding traits.

### `Ref[T]`

```goml
let cell = Ref::new(1);
let before = cell.get();
cell.set(before + 1);
```

API：

- `Ref::new(value) -> Ref[T]`
- `reference.get() -> T`
- `reference.set(value) -> unit`
- `ptr_eq(a, b) -> bool`, compare reference identities

The built-in `PartialEq`, `Eq`, and `Hash` implementations for `Ref[T]` use reference identity and do not require `T` to implement those traits. Mutating the referenced value therefore does not change equality or hashing. `Ref[T]` does not implement `Default`, because implicit allocation and recursive default construction would be surprising.

### fixed array

```goml
let mut values: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
let first = values[0];
values[1] = 20;
```

The index type is `isize`.The underlying `array_get` and `array_set` can also be called; index syntax is preferred for daily code.

### `Vec[T]`

```goml
let values = Vec::from_array([1, 2, 3]);
let first = values.get(0);
```

`Vec::from_array([values...])` creates a vector from a fixed array. Array items are evaluated once from left to right. The vector receives new outer backing storage, so replacing an array element later does not change the vector, while referenced elements remain shared because the copy is shallow. Use `Vec::new()` for an empty vector. Direct nonempty array calls coallocate the vector header and backing array. Passing an array variable retains the same shallow-copy semantics. The associated function is an ordinary first-class value, for example `let make: ([i32; 3]) -> Vec[i32] = Vec::from_array;`.

GoML 0.1.27 formatted the former `Vec::[...]` spelling to `Vec::from_array([...])`; 0.1.28 removed the former syntax.

Commonly used methods:

- `Vec::new() -> Vec[T]`
- `Vec::from_array(values: [T; N]) -> Vec[T]`
- `Vec::with_capacity(capacity) -> Vec[T]`
- `push(value) -> unit`
- `pushed(value) -> Vec[T]`
- `copy() -> Vec[T]`
- `freeze() -> FrozenVec[T]`
- `get(index) -> T`
- `set(index, value) -> unit`
- `len() -> isize`
- `capacity() -> isize`
- `is_empty() -> bool`
- `contains(value) -> bool`
- `position(predicate) -> Option[isize]`
- `sort_by(compare) -> unit`
- `stable_sort_by(compare) -> unit`
- `sort_by_ordering(compare) -> unit`
- `stable_sort_by_ordering(compare) -> unit`
- `binary_search_by(compare) -> Option[isize]`
- `binary_search_by_ordering(compare) -> Option[isize]`
- `min_by(compare) -> Option[T]`
- `max_by(compare) -> Option[T]`
- `min_by_ordering(compare) -> Option[T]`
- `max_by_ordering(compare) -> Option[T]`
- `dedup_by(equal) -> unit`
- `dedup() -> unit`
- `join(separator) -> string`
- `reserve(additional) -> unit`
- `truncate(len) -> unit`
- `clear() -> unit`
- `last() -> Option[T]`
- `pop() -> Option[T]`
- `swap(left, right) -> unit`
- `swap_remove(index) -> T`
- `insert(index, value) -> unit`
- `remove(index) -> T`
- `reverse() -> unit`
- `extend(other) -> unit`
- `slice(start, end) -> Slice[T]`
- `iter() -> FnIterator[T]`

`vec[index]` is equivalent to reading the element, `vec[index] = value;` modifies the element.

`copy()` shallow-copies the outer backing storage. `freeze()` also copies the backing storage and returns a `FrozenVec[T]`, so later structural or element changes through aliases to the original `Vec` cannot affect the frozen value.

`contains(value)` requires the element type to implement `PartialEq` and returns whether any element equals `value`.

Sorting and selection methods take an integer comparator returning negative/zero/positive, or an `Ordering` comparator for the `_ordering` variants. `dedup()` requires `PartialEq`; `position` takes a predicate; `binary_search_*` methods expect the vector to already be ordered and return the first matching index. `join(separator)` requires `ToString` and concatenates the element string forms.

### `FrozenVec[T]`

`FrozenVec[T]` is a dynamically sized read-only vector. It exposes `get`, `len`, `is_empty`, `contains`, `iter`, and `to_vec`, but no mutation methods. `to_vec()` returns a new shallow-copied mutable backing store. For nested containers, freezing is shallow: use `FrozenVec[FrozenVec[T]]` when both levels must be read-only.

### `Slice[T]`

`Slice[T]` is a bounded read-only view on the `Vec[T]` storage:

```goml
let view: Slice[i32] = values.slice(1, 3);
let item = view.get(0);
```

Commonly used methods: `get`, `len`, `contains`, `sub`, `to_vec`, `iter`.`contains(value)` requires the element type to implement `PartialEq`. `to_vec()` creates a shallow copy in a new `Vec[T]`; `view[index]` can be written, but `view[index] = value;` cannot be written.

### `HashMap[K, V]`

The key type must implement both `Hash` and `Eq`; bucket equality dispatches through the `PartialEq` supertrait:

```goml
let counts = HashMap::from_array([("a", 1), ("b", 2)]);
let value: Option[i32] = counts.get("a");
```

`HashMap::from_array([(key, value), ...])` creates a map from an entries array. It first evaluates the complete array from left to right, then inserts its pairs in array order. Later duplicate keys overwrite earlier entries. Use `HashMap::new()` for an empty map. Direct array-literal calls preallocate their build storage from the entry count. The associated function is an ordinary first-class value when its array length is fixed by a function type.

GoML 0.1.27 formatted the former map-literal spelling to `HashMap::from_array([(key, value), ...])`; 0.1.28 removed the former syntax.

Commonly used methods: `new`, `from_array`, `get`, `set`, `remove`, `len`, `contains`, and `entries`. `entries()` returns a snapshot `Vec[(K, V)]`.

Index reading returns `Option[V]`, and index assignment writes `V`:

```goml
let value = counts["a"];
counts["b"] = 2;
```

### Channels

`Channel[T]` is a Go channel backend that supports buffered and unbuffered communication:

```goml
let channel = Channel::[string]::new(0);
go || channel.send("ready");
let value: Option[string] = channel.recv();
channel.close();
```

Commonly used methods:

- `Channel::[T]::new(capacity: isize) -> Channel[T]`
- `send(value: T) -> unit`
- `recv() -> Option[T]`, returns `Option::None` when closed and drained
- `close() -> unit`
- `sender() -> Sender[T]`
- `receiver() -> Receiver[T]`
- `split() -> (Sender[T], Receiver[T])`

`Sender[T]` provides `send` and `close`; `Receiver[T]` provides `recv`. Direction is enforced statically and emitted as Go's `chan<- T` and `<-chan T`. Converting a bidirectional channel requires an explicit endpoint method. `Channel[T]` keeps its original send, receive, and close API.

Capacity `0` creates an unbuffered channel.Sending to an unbuffered channel should generally be concurrently received by another `go` closure, and vice versa.

Use `select` when a goroutine must wait on several channels, choose between sending and receiving, observe closure through `Option[T]`, or perform a non-blocking operation with `default`. The channel operands and send values are prepared once before selection.

`std::channel` provides runtime-sized homogeneous selection. `Operation[T]` is either `Receive(Receiver[T])` or `Send(Sender[T], T)`. `select` blocks, `try_select` returns `Ok(None)` when nothing is ready, and `try_select_priority` probes from the lowest input index. Successful results are `Selection::Received { index, value }` or `Selection::Sent { index }`; a closed receive carries `None`. An empty operation slice returns `SelectError::Empty`.

### Iterator

The built-in protocols are:

```goml
trait Iterator {
    type Item;
    fn next(self) -> Option[Self::Item];
}

trait IntoIterator {
    type Item;
    type IntoIter: Iterator;
    fn into_iter(self) -> Self::IntoIter;
}
```

The protocol entry points are `FnIterator::from_fn(next_fn)`, `iterator.next()` or `Iterator::next(iterator)`. `range(start, end)` and `start..end` produce incrementing half-open `FnIterator[isize]` values; `start >= end` is empty.

New code should import `std::iter` for iterator construction, adapters, and consumers:

```goml
use std::iter;

let values = iter::map(Vec::from_array([1, 2, 3]).iter(), |value: isize| value * 2);
let total = iter::fold(values, 0, |sum: isize, value: isize| sum + value);
```

- producers: `empty`, `once`, and `from_fn`
- adapters: `map`, `filter`, `filter_map`, `take`, `take_while`, `skip`, `skip_while`, `enumerate`, `zip`, `chain`, `inspect`, and `map_while`
- consumers: `fold`, `collect`, `find`, `find_map`, `any`, `all`, `count`, `position`, `nth`, `last`, `for_each`, and `reduce`

Iterators are single pass. Fixed arrays use native indexed `for` lowering. `Vec[T]` and `Slice[T]` can be directly used in `for`, and a value implementing `Iterator` is also directly iterable through the identity `IntoIterator`.

## Standard library package

The standard library is distinct from both the hidden builtin contract and the automatically scoped prelude. Its packages must be imported explicitly:

```goml
use std::ascii;
use std::bincode;
use std::bytes;
use std::cmp;
use std::collections;
use std::crypto;
use std::error;
use std::env;
use std::fs;
use std::io;
use std::iter;
use std::json;
use std::num;
use std::path;
use std::process;
use std::rand;
use std::serde;
use std::task;
use std::testing;
use std::text;
use std::toml;
use std::time;
use std::utf8;
use std::unicode;
```

Current public entrances include:

- `ascii::is_ascii`, character-class predicates, ASCII case conversion and comparison, and `escape_default`
- `bincode::standard`, `legacy`, configuration builders, serde `Serialize` and `Deserialize` re-exports, `encode_to_vec`, and `decode_from_slice`
- `bytes::Bytes`, a mutable byte buffer with conversion to and from strings and `Vec[u8]`
- `cmp::Ordering`, `Ord`, `Reverse`, comparison helpers, and two-value minimum, maximum, and clamping operations. `Ordering` is a builtin type re-exported by `cmp`.
- `collections::Arena`, `BitSet`, `Deque`, `HashSet`, `IndexMap`, `IndexVec`, `Interner`, and `Stack`; `HashSet::to_vec` returns a snapshot of its keys
- `collections::sort`, `stable_sort`, `binary_search`, `min`, `max`, and their comparator variants. The sorting, search, selection, and deduplication methods on `Vec[T]` are the canonical forms.
- `crypto::hash` one-shot SHA-256 and `crypto::rand` operating-system random bytes
- `error::Error`, `ErrorKind`, `Details`, and stable error-kind code conversion
- `env::args`, current-directory and executable queries, and environment-variable reads
- `fs::read_file`, `write_file`, byte I/O, directory operations, path inspection, and `sha256_file`
- `io::print`, `println`, `eprint`, `eprintln`, and byte-oriented standard stream I/O
- `iter::empty`, `once`, `from_fn`, iterator adapters, and single-pass consumers
- `json::Value`, `parse`, `encode`, serde `Serialize` and `Deserialize` re-exports, `to_value`, `from_value`, `try_to_string`, `try_stringify`, `to_string`, `from_string`, `field`, and typed `as_*` accessors
- `math` f32/f64 elementary functions, IEEE 754 classification, and the `E`, `PI`, `TAU`, `SQRT_2`, `LN_2`, and `LN_10` constants
- `num` string and structured parsing plus checked and saturating `i64` arithmetic
- `path::join`, `clean`, `is_absolute`, component inspection, and `absolute`
- `process::Command`, structured whole-process execution, `ExitStatus`, `Output`, `exit`, and `look_path`
- `rand::ALGORITHM`, `next_u64`, deterministic byte generation, integer ranges, and shuffle with an explicit seed
- `serde::Value`, `Serializer`, `Deserializer`, `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `value_serializer`, `value_deserializer`, `to_value`, and `from_value`
- `task::Scope`, `Task[T]`, `CancelToken`, `WaitResult[T]`, `scope`, and `try_scope`
- `testing::fail`, boolean/equality assertions, and `Option`/`Result` shape assertions
- `text::StringBuilder`; the byte-offset search, character iteration and slicing, trimming, splitting, replacement, joining, repetition, and explicit ASCII operations are string methods
- `toml::Value`, `parse`, `encode`, serde `Serialize` and `Deserialize` re-exports, `to_value`, `from_value`, `to_string`, and `from_string`
- `time::Duration`, `Instant`, `SystemTime`, `sleep`, and `sleep_with`
- `utf8::validate`, `decode`, `encode`, `encoded_len`, and `Utf8Error`
- `unicode::VERSION`, scalar properties, and Unicode case conversion using Unicode 15.0.0 tables

### Structured error foundation

`std::error` provides the common protocol used by structured standard-library errors. `Error` is a marker trait requiring `Debug` and `ToString`. `ErrorKind` defines stable, message-independent categories including missing files, permission failures, invalid input or data, timeouts, interruption, short I/O, broken pipes, unsupported operations, and `Other`.

`Error` has a blanket implementation for every value implementing `Debug` and `ToString`. This lets domain errors participate in the common protocol without making their older standard-library packages depend on the newly introduced `std::error` package during the bootstrap transition.

`kind_code` and `kind_from_code` convert between `ErrorKind` and the stable integer representation used by runtime and artifact boundaries. Unknown integer values map to `Other`. `Details` stores the stable kind code, operation, optional context, optional raw operating-system code, and a display-only message. Programs may branch on the kind code or `ErrorKind`, but must not parse the host message.

```goml
use std::error;

fn describe[E: error::Error](value: E) -> string {
    value.to_string()
}

fn example() -> string {
    let value = error::Details::new(
        error::kind_code(error::ErrorKind::NotFound),
        "read",
        Option::Some("missing.txt"),
        Option::None,
        "file does not exist",
    );
    describe(value)
}
```

The existing `io`, `fs`, `path`, `env`, `process`, and `num` string-error APIs remain unchanged during the first compatibility phase. Domain-specific error types and structured entry points are introduced only after a released stage0 can load `std::error`.

### UTF-8 validation and conversion

`std::utf8` validates byte slices and converts complete byte vectors to strings without admitting invalid UTF-8. `Utf8Error::valid_up_to` is the length of the valid prefix. `error_length` is the length of the invalid sequence when known and is `None` for an incomplete sequence at the end of the input. `encode` returns the UTF-8 bytes of a string, and `encoded_len` returns the byte length of one Unicode scalar value.

Importing `utf8::BytesUtf8` adds `Bytes::to_string_utf8`, which returns `Utf8Error`. The original `Bytes::to_string` string-error method remains available for bootstrap and source compatibility.

`text::find`, `text::rfind`, and `text::find_bytes` return byte offsets; the string methods `find`, `rfind`, and `find_bytes` are the canonical forms. `text::char_indices` yields byte offsets paired with Unicode scalar values, `text::char_count` counts scalar values, and `text::slice_chars` uses scalar-value indexes and returns `None` for an invalid range.

`std::unicode` fixes its public data version to Unicode 15.0.0. Character predicates operate on one Unicode scalar value. `lowercase` and `uppercase` apply Unicode case mapping to a complete string. `case_fold` uses the checked-in table generated by `tools/generate_unicode_casefold.py`, supports multi-scalar folds, and is locale independent.

`std::math` delegates elementary operations to Go's `math` package and follows its IEEE 754 special-value behavior. The f32 forms calculate through f64 and round the result back to f32. Results therefore use the target Go toolchain's correctly rounded conversions but do not promise bit-for-bit equality across different operating systems or processor implementations for every transcendental function.

`std::rand` uses the versioned `splitmix64-v1` algorithm. Every operation requires an explicit seed, and identical inputs produce identical outputs. It is intended for tests, simulations, sampling, and shuffling and is not cryptographically secure.

`goml test --seed N` supplies one reproducible positive seed to every test process through `testing::seed()`. Failure summaries print the replay seed, and every JSON result event includes it. Captured stdout and stderr remain isolated per test process and are emitted only for failures unless `--nocapture` is selected.

Parameterized tests use one or more `#[test_case(...)]` attributes on a top-level function. This release accepts string and boolean arguments and validates them against the function parameters. Each case receives a content-derived stable ID, while list, filter, text/JSON reporting, artifact manifests, and CodeLens continue to use its readable display name. Ordinary zero-argument `#[test]` functions remain unchanged.

`std::crypto::hash::sha256` returns the lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 digest of a byte buffer, and `sha256_file` hashes a complete file before returning. `std::crypto::rand::bytes` reads the requested number of bytes from the operating-system cryptographic random source. These APIs do not expose hasher or random-source handles.

`Duration` provides checked and saturating scaled constructors, addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Checked operations return `None` on overflow, underflow, or a negative input. Saturating operations clamp to zero or the largest signed 64-bit nanosecond value. `Duration`, `Instant`, and `SystemTime` expose `compare`; `Instant::checked_duration_since` returns `None` when the receiver precedes the supplied instant.

`fs::read_file_structured`, `read_bytes_structured`, `write_file_structured`, and `write_bytes_structured` are the additive structured-error forms of whole-file I/O. They return `fs::Error` with a stable `io::ErrorKind`, operation, path, optional raw operating-system code, and display message. The original string-error functions remain available during the compatibility period.

`fs::create_dir`, `rename`, `copy`, `hard_link`, and `symbolic_link` are eager operations returning `fs::Error`. `copy` reads and writes the complete file and currently creates the destination with portable `0644` permissions; it does not preserve source metadata.

`fs::metadata` and `symlink_metadata` return value-only metadata including file type, length, portable permission bits, and modification time. `read_dir_structured` eagerly snapshots directory entries. `atomic_write` writes, synchronizes, closes, and atomically renames a same-directory temporary file before returning; temporary cleanup stays inside the runtime call. `replace` exposes the host atomic rename operation under replacement semantics.

`io::read_stdin_structured`, `read_stdin_exact_structured`, `write_stdout_structured`, and `write_stderr_structured` provide the same additive migration for standard streams. `read_stdin_to_string` validates the complete input as UTF-8 and reports `InvalidData` on failure. A negative exact-read length reports `InvalidInput` before accessing stdin.

`num::parse_int_structured`, radix and unsigned variants, and the structured float parsers return domain parse errors without changing the original parsing entry points. The `checked_*_int64` operations return `None` on overflow; the corresponding `saturating_*_int64` operations clamp to the signed 64-bit bounds.

`env::current_dir_structured`, `current_exe_structured`, and `var_structured`, `path::absolute_structured`, and `process` structured execution methods are additive whole-operation forms. Process timeout methods take `time::Duration`, terminate and wait through the existing command runtime, and return `TimedOut` instead of a separate boolean.

Paths remain UTF-8 `string` values. `path::separator` reports the host separator, `components` recognizes both slash forms, `relative` uses host path rules, and `windows_prefix` recognizes drive and UNC prefixes independently of the host operating system. Non-UTF-8 operating-system names cannot be represented and therefore cannot appear in these APIs.

### Bincode typed binary data

`std::bincode` is primarily a typed serde format. `encode_to_vec` writes the requested type directly to the output buffer, while `decode_from_slice` lets the requested type pull its fields directly from the input and returns the value together with the number of consumed bytes. The typed path does not construct `serde::Value` or request a runtime schema. The lower-level `encode_value` and `decode_value` functions remain available for explicit dynamic work; `decode_value` needs an explicitly supplied schema because bincode does not carry field types, tuple lengths, or struct layouts on the wire.

The typed encoder and decoder validate every compound begin, element or field, and end transition. A malformed handwritten serde implementation returns an error instead of producing partial data or panicking. Decode errors include both the byte offset and a path through positional fields, collection elements, map entries, and enum variants.

`bincode::standard()` uses little-endian variable integer encoding. `bincode::legacy()` uses little-endian fixed-width integers. `with_little_endian`, `with_big_endian`, `with_variable_int_encoding`, and `with_fixed_int_encoding` return adjusted configurations. The wire representation follows bincode 2 conventions for booleans, ZigZag signed varints, integer markers, IEEE floating-point bits, UTF-8 strings, collection lengths, one-byte option tags, source-order struct fields, and enum declaration indexes.

```goml
use std::bincode;
use bincode::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Message {
    id: u32,
    text: string,
}

fn round_trip(value: Message) -> Result[Message, string] {
    let encoded = bincode::encode_to_vec(value, bincode::standard())?;
    let decoded: (Message, isize) = bincode::decode_from_slice(
        encoded.slice(0, encoded.len()),
        bincode::standard(),
    )?;
    Result::Ok(decoded.0)
}
```

The first version supports the shared serde primitives, byte slices through custom direct implementations, `Vec`, `Option`, two- and three-element tuples, and derived structs and enums. Fixed arrays are not yet supported because GoML does not yet have const-generic serde implementations. Dynamic `serde::Value`, `json::Value`, and `toml::Value` do not describe the concrete binary layout needed by typed bincode decode.

### TOML values and typed documents

`std::toml` follows the same public split as JSON. `toml::Value` has string, signed 64-bit integer, 64-bit float, boolean, datetime text, array, and table variants. `parse` and `encode` operate on that schema-free representation. `to_value`, `from_value`, `to_string`, and `from_string` use the shared serde traits and enforce the destination type. TOML still plans a complete table tree before emission because headers and dotted paths require document-wide organization; it is compatible with the streaming traits but is not currently a fully direct format. Unsigned values above the TOML signed-integer range are rejected, and unit or `None` cannot be encoded because TOML has no null value.

The first parser accepts basic and literal strings, Unicode escapes, booleans, decimal and base-prefixed integers, floats, datetime text, arrays, inline tables, dotted keys, and ordinary table headers. It preserves table and field order for deterministic output. Multiline strings, array-of-table headers, and dotted keys inside inline tables are not yet supported.

```goml
use std::toml;
use toml::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Server {
    host: string,
    port: u16,
}

fn load(input: string) -> Result[Server, string] {
    toml::from_string(input)
}
```

`std::ascii` operates on `byte`. Classification and case conversion use only the 7-bit ASCII range, and bytes above `0x7f` remain unchanged. `escape_default` emits short escapes for tabs, carriage returns, newlines, quotes, and backslashes, preserves printable ASCII, and uses lowercase `\\xNN` escapes for other bytes.

`std::cmp` provides `PartialOrd` and `Ord`. `unit`, `bool`, `string`, `char`, and all signed and unsigned integer types implement both. Floating-point values implement only `PartialOrd`, because NaN does not form a total order; comparison with NaN yields `Option::None`. Tuples, fixed arrays, `Vec`, `Slice`, `Option`, and `Result` implement the comparison traits conditionally and use lexicographic order. `cmp::compare` returns `Ordering::Less`, `Equal`, or `Greater`; `Ordering` supports predicates, reversal, lexicographic chaining, and conversion to the negative/zero/positive integer convention. `cmp::Reverse[T]` reverses an existing ordering. `cmp::clamp` returns an error when the minimum exceeds the maximum.

The prelude `Default` implementations use `()` for `unit`, `false` for `bool`, zero for numeric types, and the empty string for `string`. `Vec` and `HashMap` default to empty containers, and the standard collection types `HashSet`, `IndexMap`, `Stack`, `Deque`, `BitSet`, `Arena`, `IndexVec`, and `Interner` likewise default through their empty constructors. `Option[T]` defaults to `None` without requiring `T: Default`, while tuples and fixed arrays default each element. `Result[T, E]` and `Ref[T]` intentionally have no global default implementation.

### Structured concurrency

`std::task` creates lexical task scopes on top of goroutines:

```goml
use std::task;

fn load_pair() -> Result[(isize, isize), string] {
    task::try_scope(
        |scope: task::Scope| {
            let left = scope.spawn_try(|cancel| load_left(cancel));
            let right = scope.spawn_try(|cancel| load_right(cancel));
            Result::Ok((left.join()?, right.join()?))
        },
    )
}
```

The contextual `scope` and `spawn` forms provide the same structured lifetime with a hidden scope capability:

```goml
use std::task;

fn load_pair() -> Result[(isize, isize), string] {
    scope {
        let left = spawn |cancel| load_left(cancel);
        let right = spawn |cancel| load_right(cancel);
        Result::Ok((left.join()?, right.join()?))
    }
}
```

`scope { body }` is lowered before HIR checking to `task::scope(|hidden_scope| body)`, and each directly nested `spawn |cancel| body` is lowered to `hidden_scope.spawn(|cancel| body)`. The file must import `std::task`. Directly nested lexical scopes use `scope_with` and inherit their parent's cancellation. The hidden scope value cannot be named or returned. A lexical `spawn` cannot cross a user closure boundary, which prevents a returned closure from capturing the capability; create a nested `scope` inside that closure instead. `scope` and `spawn` remain ordinary identifiers outside these contextual forms.

`scope` stops accepting new work after its body returns, waits for every direct child task, and then returns the body's value. It still waits when a `Task[T]` handle is discarded. `Task::join` may be called repeatedly or concurrently; every call observes the same stored result. `Scope::try_spawn` returns `Some(task)` when it registers the task before closing begins and `None` after the scope starts closing. Ordinary `Scope::spawn` retains the stricter runtime-error behavior for closed scopes.

`try_scope` cancels its scope when the body returns `Result::Err`, waits for all direct children to exit, and then returns the original error. `Scope::spawn_try` also cancels sibling tasks as soon as its child returns `Result::Err`. A nested scope inherits cancellation when it is created with `scope_with(parent_token, body)` or `try_scope_with(parent_token, body)`.

Cancellation is cooperative. `Scope::cancel` changes the state observed by `CancelToken::is_cancelled`; it does not forcibly terminate a goroutine. Blocking work can use:

- `task::recv_with(token, channel) -> WaitResult[Option[T]]`
- `task::send_with(token, channel, value) -> WaitResult[unit]`
- `time::sleep_with(token, duration) -> WaitResult[unit]`
- `Command::output_with(token) -> Result[WaitResult[Output], string]`
- `Command::status_with(token) -> Result[WaitResult[ExitStatus], string]`

`CancelToken::done() -> Receiver[unit]` exposes the scope context's shared completion channel, and `Task::done() -> Receiver[unit]` exposes the task's shared ready channel. Neither method starts a bridge goroutine. A task stores its result before closing the ready channel, so `join()` is immediately observable after its completion event.

`std::time::Timer::new(duration)` creates a stoppable one-shot timer. `done()` returns its `Receiver[unit]`, `stop()` reports whether it prevented a pending firing, and `time::after(duration)` is the one-shot convenience form. A successful stop leaves the completion channel unready. Timer firing and stopping are synchronized so the channel closes at most once.

`WaitResult::Cancelled` means cancellation woke the operation. Process cancellation uses the host command context, so the scope waits for the process operation to return before it exits. Task scopes never close user channels automatically. `active_scope_count()` exposes the number of live runtime scopes for tests and leak diagnostics.

GoML has no lifetime or linear type system, so a `Scope` value can currently escape its body. Calling `spawn` after the scope begins closing is a runtime error. Panic remains a fatal runtime exception and is not converted into `Result`. A panic in the scope body or a child task cancels sibling tasks, waits for them, removes the runtime scope, and is then re-raised in the scope owner.

`join_all` returns values in input order. `join_all_results` waits for every task and returns errors in input order, independent of goroutine scheduling.

`join_all_indexed_results` preserves each error's input index. `for_each_concurrent(limit, values, body)` runs at most `limit` calls at once, uses one worker when the limit is non-positive, waits for every value, and returns indexed errors in input order. `ConcurrencyLimit::run` can apply the same cooperative limit to custom task layouts.

`race(bodies)` returns the first completed value, cancels the remaining bodies, and still waits for every losing body to exit. It returns `None` for an empty input. A body that does not cooperate with cancellation can therefore delay the return from `race`.

### `collections::IndexMap[K, V]`

`IndexMap` is an insertion-ordered hash map. Its key type must implement `Eq` and `Hash`, while actual key comparison uses `PartialEq`:

```goml
use std::collections;

let headers: collections::IndexMap[string, string] =
    collections::IndexMap::new();
headers.insert("content-type", "text/plain");
headers.insert("content-length", "12");
headers.insert("content-type", "application/json");

for (name, value) in headers {
    println(name + ": " + value)
}
```

Inserting a new key appends it to the iteration order. Replacing an existing value does not move the key. Removing and inserting the key again appends it to the end.

Common methods are `new`, `with_capacity`, `len`, `is_empty`, `contains`, `get`, `insert`, `remove`, `reserve`, `clear`, `entries`, `keys`, `values`, and `iter`. `insert` and `remove` return the previous value as `Option[V]`. `entries`, `keys`, and `values` return ordered snapshots, while `iter` and `for` traverse `(K, V)` pairs in insertion order.

The implementation uses a sparse open-addressed index table and an insertion-ordered entry array. Deleted entries become tombstones and are compacted during later growth or when deletion density becomes high. Lookup, insertion, and removal are expected O(1); iteration and compaction are O(n). Structural mutation while an iterator is active is unsupported.

`IndexMap` does not currently have literal or indexing syntax. Use `insert` and `get`.

File system operations use `Result[..., string]` to report errors, and can be combined with `?`.

Text search indices are UTF-8 byte offsets, matching the indices accepted by the built-in string APIs. `starts_with_at` returns false for out-of-range and non-character-boundary offsets. `rfind` returns the last matching byte offset. Trimming recognizes ASCII whitespace. Splitting on an empty separator returns the original string as one item, while `split_once` with an empty separator returns `Option::None`.

Numeric parsing returns `Result[_, string]` and is implemented by the GoML standard library. Integer radix parsing accepts radix `0` or `2..36`; radix `0` recognizes `0b`, `0o`, and `0x` prefixes and permits Go-style digit separators. Invalid radices, malformed input, and overflow return `Result::Err`. Floating-point parsing supports decimal and hexadecimal IEEE 754 input, signed exponents, digit separators, `inf`, `infinity`, and `NaN`, and rounds directly to the requested `f32` or `f64` width.

Sorting mutates a `Vec[T]` in place. `sort` and `stable_sort` use `cmp::Ord`; `sort_by_ordering` and `stable_sort_by_ordering` use `cmp::Ordering`. The older `sort_by` and `stable_sort_by` variants accept negative/zero/positive integer comparators. All current sorting variants are stable. `binary_search` and its comparator-based variants expect the vector to already be ordered and return the first matching index.

`Duration` stores a non-negative number of nanoseconds and offers constructors and whole-unit accessors for nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds, and seconds. Subtraction saturates at zero. `Instant` is monotonic and is suitable for elapsed-time measurement. `SystemTime` exposes Unix nanosecond, millisecond, and second timestamps. `time::sleep` blocks the current goroutine for a `Duration`.

## Informal Grammar Quick Facts

The following EBNF only describes the canonical form that should be generated; `?` means optional, `*` means repeated, and the terminator is placed in quotes.

The parser will do some error recovery for commas and semicolons, but the code agent should always generate the above canonical form: list items separated by commas, `let`, assignments and ordinary non-tail expressions with semicolons, control flow statements without semicolons, trait method signatures with semicolons.The sequence pattern contains at most one rest; the `..` in the structure pattern appears at most once and must be at the end.

## Verify generated code

After building stage 1, verify a standalone source file from the repository root:

```sh
stage1/bin/gomlc run-single path/to/main.gom
```

For a project, run the installed driver from anywhere inside its module:

```sh
goml check
goml build
goml check --tests
goml test
goml run
goml fmt
```

`goml check`, `goml build`, `goml test`, and `goml fmt` always operate on the complete module and do not accept package or file targets. `goml run [TARGET]` accepts an optional entry package file or directory when a module has multiple executable packages.

When you need to inspect a compilation phase, add `--dump-ast`, `--dump-expanded-ast`, `--dump-hir`, `--dump-tast`, `--dump-ctir`, `--dump-core`, `--dump-mono`, `--dump-lift`, `--dump-anf`, or `--dump-go` to `gomlc run-single`. `--dump-ast` shows source lowering before derive expansion, while `--dump-expanded-ast` includes every generated implementation.

The code agent should at least run the corresponding `goml check` or `gomlc run-single` before submitting the source code; when modifying the test, it should also run `goml check --tests` and the related `goml test`.When type inference fails, give priority to adding local result types, empty container types, closure parameter types, or using UFCS instead of rewriting to unsupported Rust/Go syntax.
