# goml

goml is a statically typed programming language inspired by Go and Rust.

The "ml" in goml nods to the [ML (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)), whose descendants have deeply influenced Rust.

goml aims to empower gophers with a more powerful type system but without leaving the Go ecosystem.

If you want to gain a quick, basic sense of what the goml language looks like, you can explore the test materials inside the [crates/compiler/src/tests/pipeline](crates/compiler/src/tests/pipeline). Files ending in `.gom` contain the original goml source code, `.go` files are the compiled outputs, `.out` files are the program's stdout. You can also visit the project page at [lijunchen.github.io/goml/](https://lijunchen.github.io/goml/), which provides the same content as the test directory but presented in a convenient web‑browsable format.
