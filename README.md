# goml

goml is a statically typed programming language inspired by Go and Rust.

The "ml" in goml nods to the [ML (programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)), whose descendants have deeply influenced Rust.

goml aims to empower gophers with a more powerful type system but without leaving the Go ecosystem.
